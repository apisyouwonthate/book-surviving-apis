== Coming Soon

This book is a still an ongoing process, and more chapters will be
coming. Much like _Build APIs You Won't Hate_, I'l be aiming for one
chapter a month. Here's a few that I expect to add in before considering
the book complete:

* API Proxies
* State Management
* Form Generation
* Offline Syncing
* Asynchronous Requests

I'm also trying to figure out how to get AMQP and WebSocket in here,
possible with their own sections. It will get there.

If you have any ideas, requests, questions, or feedback, please get in

I hope you enjoyed the content so far!
