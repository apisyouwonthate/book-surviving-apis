= Coming Soon

This book is a still an ongoing process, and more chapters will be coming. Much
like _Build APIs You Won't Hate_, we are aiming for one chapter a month. Here's
are a few you can expect to see soon:

* API Proxies
* State Management
* Form Generation
* Offline Syncing
* Testing API Dependencies

We are also trying to figure out how to get AMQP and WebSocket in here,
possibly with their own sections. It will get there.

If you have any ideas, requests, questions, or feedback, please get in

We hope you enjoyed the content so far!
