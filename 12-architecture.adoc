= Architecture

Frontend application developers might not need to spend too much time thinking about systems architecture, but this chapter applies to frontend developers as much as it does backend developers. All client application developers need to consider how their application is going to interact with its dependencies, either directly, via a service mesh, via a BFF (Backend for Frontend), or some sort of combination.

The architecture you implement will effect the stability and overall success of your application and the ecosystem around it. As with everything there are pros and cons of all the approaches, and use-cases where one would make sense over another. 

== Direct Dependencies

The first thing that comes to mind when trying to interact with a dependency is just interact with that dependency directly. Mobile and desktop applications generally have settings baked in at build time, but web applications and backend systems do things in a variety of ways.

Some applications get domain names hardcoded in, hopefully as a constant, but sometimes the host name is literred throughout the code all over the place; literally a `https://api.example.com` gets shoved into code. This can lead to testing data going off to production environments, and mean quick "agh the DNS is broken push a deploy" leading to a whole bunch of downtime as that build chugs its way through whatever deployment process is employed. It can also lead to staging/testing/not-production environments firing off traffic to the production server... never do this.

Some applications have configuration managers and environment variables to store the IP/hostname, which mean there is a config option setting `ENV[FOO_API_HOST] = https://api.example.com`, and the code just references that environment variable. This is very similar to the mobile/desktop application approach, and adds the benefit of being able to notice when an application is not set up with the right config. Crashing on startup instead of leaking information off to a prod environment is a little safer.

Some very lucky ecosystems might use "service discovery", which is a special service in charge of knowing where everything is. This is more likely to be used internally, when there is a backup service which might be waiting to take over from the primary service if it goes down. Consider the situation where `https://api.example.com` is down and `https://api-secondary.example.com` is ready to go. All those hardcoded applications would be toast for a while, and the configuration users will be quickly updating their config and restarting the app. Those using service discovery won't have to do anything, as api-secondary has already told the service catalog it is ready to accept traffic. 

Service discovery is probably not an option when calling external APIs, you just have to hope whatever hostname they have is right, and not changing, and if it is randomly going to change (rebranding, aquisition, etc) then... well hopefully they advertise this well somehow.

Whatever means the client application is using to get the IP/hostname for a dependency, if calls are being made directly to the dependency there are fewer moving parts, but a lot of things that can go wrong. 

_Chapter 9: Timeouts, Retries and Circuit Breakers_ talked about this a lot, but an application having a direct dependency on an application can lead to all sorts of headaches. Generally implementing a service mesh with circuit breakers is going to help out a lot with potential performance issues, but they are generic tools which do not help with with the scariest of all things in dependencies: Change!

=== Change

Hopefully the API is using a reasonable approach to change management: they communicate upcoming change a long way ahead of time, offer alternative solutions to anything being deprecated, and chase applications still using the old approach. 

This is not always the case. Google Maps ditched their free mapping offering, Facebook regularly just turn off various APIs for whatever reason, and Meetup decided to ditch their API for any customers who were not Pro. 

Stuff can just vanish, especially if its a third-party API. If you are coupling your client application with a direct dependency on an API, the impact of that API vanishing can be devastating.

In the past, I've worked at companies who've used alternative mapping solutions which got bought out by some bigger company, then immediately sunset. We had to pull a rush job to switch all mobile apps, web apps, and backend services over to Google Maps and deploy them all. When we did, we made a generic "mapping service" which would proxy requests to Google Maps in the background. This meant we could switch mapping providers more easily and its end-users on mobile/desktop apps were not stuck with a broken experience.


=== Consistency

Most clients will talk to more than one API. In 2010-15 most organizations getting into API-based architectures might have 1 API, but that started ballooning into double and triple digits with the onset of the microservice trend. 

If your client needs to talk to more than a few APIs, you will probably almost immediately notice inconsistencies between the APIs. Maybe some are internal to your organization and some are external, and that alone means you are interacting with a mixture of GraphQL, REST, gRPC or SOAP.

Maybe you are only talking to internal APIs but they were all built before anyone had a chance to think of a style guide, or your organization just does not care about creating consistent experiences and lets everyone create totally different HTTP authentication approaches, REST hypermedia formats, GraphQL errors are all completely different, and everyone has invented special snowflakes, instead of leveraging API gateways for consistent functionality and https://stoplight.io/open-source/spectral/[enforcing style-guides] with automated tools.

Whatever is going on, talking to multiple APIs probably means dealing with a lot of inconsistency, and without good SDKs that can be a real pain. 

For this, some people use the BFF pattern.

== Backends for Frontends (BFF)

A BFF is an API built for the specific needs of a client. This sounds counterintuitive at first because many of us were taught that APIs must be so generic they can be used by multiple clients, even if those clients require rather different content.

image::images/arch-bff.jpg[A mobile app and a desktop app both have their own BFF, which each talk to a bunch of downstream services]

Trying to make an API so generic that it is useable for every client usually means it is not optimized for any clients. That might be fine depending on how many clients there are, or what they are doing, or how much traffic is coming through the ecosystem, but eventually generic APIs become a source of frustration for the developers who want to build more optimized workflows or data models. 

The worse the design of the remote models the more this starts to become ideal. If you are talking to one of those HTTP/1.1-based RESTish APIs which has jammed 25 resources into a single payload for some reason, but your iPhone application only needs 3 of those resources, making all that extra data go over the wire rather quickly becomes annoying. 

A BFF is a chance for your team to optimize payloads, by grabbing these larger chunks of data and returning only what thinks you probably need. 

BFFs also let you solve authentication inconsistencies between the various APIs a client needs to talk to, by letting the end user authenticate with your BFF, then it creates various JWTs, bearer tokens, cookies, and heck knows what else, all stored internally in the BFF API so the client doesn't have to juggle all that nonsense. 

Mainly a BFF is about providing consistency for the client, even when change happens. If an external provider says they're closing down, your BFF team can update the BFF to proxy off to an alternative service, or even in a pinch make their own replacement service, all of which can reuse the same interface for seamless transitions for the end user. No application updates or down-time required. 

BFFs sound like a lot of work, and they are. Extra development means extra time is spent on this and not on features. You may also need extra developers, and these developers might even need to be new hires if your whole team is more frontend than backend.

The canonical example of BFFs is Netflix, who used to make one API for their iPhone client app, another for web app, another their XBox client app, etc. Your company may not have pockets as deep as Netflix, and honestly your clients might not be that different from each other.

When it comes to delivering the same (or similar) user experience on different platforms, I have seen two different approaches. The model I prefer is to strictly have a single BFF for each different type of client - this is a model I saw used at REA:

image::images/arch-bff-per-mobile.jpg[Even more specific BFF APIs, one for an Android client and another for an iPhone client.]

Your iOS and Android application might be basically identical, so maybe they could share a BFF. Then maybe there is an internal dashboard which is more about CRUD and statistics, this could just be an "Admin API", which powers a web dashboard and an iOS admin/management app. Dogmatic BFFs can be unrealistic and too extreme for many, so consider a reasonable variation: backends for groups of frontends.

The other model, which I have seen in use at SoundCloud, uses one BFF per type of user interface. So both the Android and iOS versions of the listener native application use the same BFF:

image::images/arch-bff-group.jpg[Here an iPhone and Android client application both talk to the mobile BFF.]

My main concern with the second model is just that the more types of clients you have using a single BFF, the more temptation there may be for it to become bloated by handling multiple concerns. The key thing to understand here though is that even when sharing a BFF, it is for the same class of user interface - so while SoundCloud's listener Native applications for both iOS and Android use the same BFF, other native applications would use different BFFs (for example the new Creator application Pulse uses a different BFF). 

I'm also more relaxed about using this model if the same team owns both the Android and iOS applications and own the BFF too - if these applications are maintained by different teams, I'm more inclined to recommend the more strict model. So you can see your organisation structure as being one of the main drivers to which model makes the most sense (Conway's Law wins again). It's worth noting that the SoundCloud engineers I spoke to suggested that having one BFF for both Android and iOS listener applications was something they might reconsider if making the decision again today.

One guideline that I really like from Stewart Gleadow (who in turn credited Phil Calçado and Mustafa Sezgin) was 'one experience, one BFF'. So if the iOS and Android experiences are very similar, then it is easier to justify having a single BFF. If however they diverge greatly, then having separate BFFs makes more sense.

Creating a BFF means you need to figure out the appropriate API paradigm. The two main contenders in this space are GraphQL and REST.

== GraphQL BFFs

GraphQL as a facade over REST has generally been advertised by some as a way to "move away from bad REST and start using lovely GraphQL", which always felt like an odd sales pitch. 

There are two common arguments, neither of which have much merit, but you should be aware of them.

1. REST APIs are not performant, so use GraphQL as a thin facade to speed things up by munging multiple resources together over the wire. 

2. REST APIs are not consistent, so use GraphQL as a BFF to give your client application one consistent interface to query.

The first is a confusion of network optimizations, and focuses too much on batching. This can lead clients spending two seconds waiting for one mega query, when they could have spent 300ms waiting for multiple queries to be made asynchronously. Be wary of anyone making these sorts of claims at your company. 

As for the second argument: yes REST APIs have [a lot of different standards](https://standards.rest/). A bunch of inconsistent APIs in an ecosystem can be a pain in the backside for sure. 

Using GraphQL as a single "nice" interface over "your old smelly REST APIs" is a stance popularized by Apollo, offering a featured called Schema Stitching built into their server software.

[source,javacript]
----
class MoviesAPI extends RESTDataSource {
  baseURL = 'https://movies-api.example.com';

  async getMovie(id: string) {
    return this.get(`movies/${id}`);
  }

  async getMostViewedMovies(limit: number = 10) {
    const data = await this.get('movies', {
      per_page: limit,
      order_by: 'most_viewed',
    });
    return data.results;
  }
}
----

Mapping these RPCish endpoint-grabs to a "data source" means GraphQL APIs can query the REST API just like it's a GraphQL API. 

This can make sense when the client is trying to a variety of different external APIs, but this has been advertised as something being done with internal APIs. To me the idea that multiple client application teams are running around building these GraphQL BFFs because the internal APIs are so inconsistent, suggests a huge smell at the company. 

More generally speaking the GraphQL BFF pattern seems like an odd choice for any clients that want to leverage HTTP appropriately. GraphQL adds a nice consistent type system, but the lack of endpoints means HTTP-based caching is no longer viable, HTTP/2 is out the window, hypermedia (using HTTP as a state machine for complex workflows) is gone, and the whole "ask for only what you need" approach to picking fields should not be necessary when talking to an API which is designed specifically to power a specific client. 

GraphQL as a BFF can be useful for creating backends for groups of frontends, because there might be certain properties which are added for one of the client applications in this group of incredibly similar applications. 

This is extra applicable if those frontends are dealing with real-time information and have no interest in caching, and instead of using HTTP/2 for grabbing related data they can subscribe to WebSockets for streams of data, which GraphQL integrates rather well. 

This is also applicable if the apps are mostly handling CRUD and do not have "workflows", which REST is a lot better at handling.

== REST BFFs

A lot of the reasoning for "GraphQL as a BFF" are just as applicable to "REST as a BFF". Basically old badly designed RESTish APIs can be wrapped with a well designed REST API, 
which is using JSON Schema for a type system, or it can wrap gRPC, SOAP, and all sorts of other dependencies, all with one consistent interface.

A REST API operating over HTTP also has the chance to leverage all of HTTP instead of just a subset, providing solid HTTP caching conventions, full HTTP/2 support, and hypermedia controls. 

In my experience the "REST API for Frontend Groups" argument would have solved some rather frustrating problems. An iOS and a Web version of the same internal application was consistently receiving bug reports, where the same employee could see a button on the web app, but could not on the iOS app, even though it should have been the same. 

This was due to some complex if statements checking 5 different things, and one of the apps forgot to check a 6th thing, so the state was out of whack. Hoisting these states up into the REST API mean that one API can interpret arbitrary data from all over the ecosystem. This data could be from hypermedia controls on other REST APIs, or random flags and settings elsewhere, or GraphQL APIs, or a gRPC API, or a local Redis DB, or based on OAtuh scopes, or any combination of the above. 

Whatever conclusions the BFF comes to about the state as it pertains to this client group, the whole group of clients get that same conclusion instead of everyone in the group all trying to figure it out independently.

== Summary

Direct dependencies are not terrible, despite having potential downsides. Depending on the size of your team, and what sort of phase the organization is in, they may be an unideal reality. Consider it a necessary shortcut for prototypes, MVPs, and early stage startups, etc. 

If you are counting the runway of your company in months, direct dependencies are probably fine, because getting the job done, proving the concept, beating your competition, surviving to raise more, etc. is probably more important than making your client resilient to potential change which may not come for a year or two. 

That said don't blame me if you build your entire startup around a single API which vanishes next week. It's impossible to predict the future, but you should consider what sort of priorities you have, before committing limited resources to building out loads of BFFs which might really not be all that important just yet.
