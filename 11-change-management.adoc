= Change Management

Change Management in relation to APIs, is a collective term for making
improvements over time. Hopefully the change is handled in a
non-breaking fashion, giving you ample time to make necessary changes.

There are a two main approaches to change.

*Versioning* - Shoving a version number (v1, v2, v3) next to things, or
in some odd cases the version is a date. The version might apply to the
entire API (global versioning), or a single resource (resource
versioning).

*Evolution* - Instead of versioning the whole API, or specific
resources/endpoints, some APIs will instead chose to carefully evolve
their interface over time.

Let's go more in depth into these concepts, and how they come into
effect in various API paradigms.

== REST / "Endpoint-based" APIs

**Global Versioning**

API endpoints are grouped (essentially "namespaced") under a
version number, e.g.
https://hostname/v1/companies[`https://hostname/v1/companies`], to make
it clear that a `/v1/companies` has no relation whatsoever to a
`/v2/companies`.

In http://semver.org/[SemVer] terms, the version number in the URL is a
major version. You should expect no breaking changes to occur in this
major version, as that would be the job for a new major version. All
resources should be copied from the old version to the new version,
unless they're being discontinued.

Most APIs will not bother with minor or patch versions, because minor
and patch changes are backwards compatible. Adding new fields to
responses, new optional fields to requests or new resources will not
break implementations, so that can be done without needing a major
version. Changing validation rules, removing fields, or drastic changes
to relationships, are things that may require a new major version be
created.

Usually old versions will be maintained for a reasonable timeframe, but
what's considered reasonable is completely up to the API maintainers. It
could be one month, a year, or anything in between.

=== Evolution

API evolution is the concept of striving to maintain the "I" in API, the
request/response body, query parameters, general functionality, etc.,
only breaking them when you absolutely, absolutely, have to; then when
you do, you manage that change with sensible warnings to clients. It's
the idea that API developers bending over backwards to maintain a
contract, no matter how annoying that might be, is often more
financially and logistically viable than dumping the workload onto a
wide array of clients. No version numbers exist in the URL, headers, or
query string, and no two versions of the same resource will exist at any
given time. There is only the "current version".

Just like in global versioning, backwards compatible changes like adding
new methods to existing resources, new fields to responses, new optional
fields to requests, new resources, etc. These can happen any time,
without clients needing to change anything. For example, splitting
"name" into "first_name" and "last_name". The "name" field would still
appear in responses along with the new first_name and last_name fields,
and could still be sent. This is a perfect evolution, because nothing
broke for the client, and the server supports the new functionality -
allowing folks to be specific about their first and last names instead
of the server guessing by splitting on space or something silly.

Where evolution differs from global versioning, is that instead of
creating a whole new namespace (forcing clients that don't even use the
specific changing resources to update/test code at great time and
expense), a single new resource is made to replace the existing resource
when adding new fields is not going to cover the use-case.

For example, a carpooling company that has "matches" as a relationship
between "drivers" and "passengers", suggesting folks who could ride
together, containing properties like "passenger_id" and "driver_id".
They realized they need to support carpools with multiple drivers (i.e.
Frank and Sally both take it in turns to drive), so this whole matches
concept is garbage.

At a lot of startups, this sort of conceptual change is common. No
number of new properties is going to help out here, as the whole "one
record = one match = one driver + one passenger" concept is foiled.

Deprecating the whole concept of "matches", a new concept of "riders" is
created. This resource tracks folks far beyond just being "matched",
through the whole lifecycle of the carpool, thanks to a `status`
property containing pending, active, inactive, blocked, etc.

By creating the `/riders` endpoint, this resource can have a brand new
representation. The API maintainers may well be converting matches to
riders - or riders to matches - in the background, but clients don't
need to care about that. Clients can then use either one, allowing them
the change to upgrade at their own pace.

== GraphQL

GraphQL also uses the evolution approach, and this works the same as the
REST / "Endpoint-based" API evolution approach. GraphQL APIs following
evolution carefully will try to avoid breaking changes, sticking to
backwards compatible changes like adding optional fields to mutations
and queries, new arguments on fields, new relationships, etc.

When these backwards compatible changes are not going to be enough to
provide the new functionality required, new mutations and new types
might be created: just like the matches and riders example above. In
another system, maybe a "Company" becomes an "Account" if that is more
appropriate to the constantly changing business language, but maybe
Company2 is created if not. This should only be done when the existing
type is utterly unable to bend to the new rules of the context, and
simply suggesting new fields cannot satisfy requirements.

Global versioning is not possible in GraphQL. When raised with Facebook
the topic was closed with a WONTFIX, so you will not have to worry about
that.

=== Deprecations

Regardless of the type of API you are interacting with, and which
approach it takes to change management, deprecation is going to be an
important part of keeping up with the change. Any time a change is not
just additive, deprecation will be used to communicate a breaking
change.

Deprecation is the art of telling people to stop using a thing, because
that thing is probably going away at some point. Even if there are no
solid plans to delete the thing entirely, the thing might be deprecated
just because it sucks to work with, but usually it's because it has been
replaced with a better idea.

Sadly there are no promises the team in charge will deprecate things
cautiously. Some API providers act like jerks and just arbitrarily
change things, remove things, and break stuff. Closing APIs down with no
warning (or poor warning) is utterly disgraceful behavior, but it does
happen. Facebook especially like to pull the rug out on their API users.
Sometimes breaking changes are introduced accidentally.

Usually a more reasonable approach is taken, and API providers will
communicate change in a variety of ways. There are a few common methods
to keeping up with the changing happening to an API integrated into your
codebase.

== Low-Tech General Solutions

As ludicrous as it might sound, the entire extent of some API providers
attempts to communicate upcoming change is "write a blog about it and
hope you notice."

These blog articles explain things like "Hey we're closing off the free
access to this API", or "We are replacing this Foo API with a Bar API,
and you have 3 months to stop using the Foo API before we shut it down".
Fingers crossed you see it!

This low-tech approach has no real solutions I can think of, other
than... subscribe to the api providers engineering blog on RSS, and - so
long as the RSS reader you're using doesn't get shut down - you might
notice the article. If they have a newsletter then subscribe to that,
maybe with a "devs@" email address or team-specific email address, to
improve the bus factor on this. You don't want the announcement going to
a member of the team who's quit, then the API breaks just because the
rest of the team didn't know about the change.

APIs requiring authentication will usually ask for an email address in
return for the authentication credentials (API keys, access tokens,
etc.) This gives API providers one more way to get in touch about
change, and again, make sure it's not the email of a manager or team
lead, but a distribution email address for the team.

== REST / Endpoint-based APIs

If an API is using global versioning, then they might deprecate all the
endpoints under `/v1/` at the same time, and suggest you use all the
`/v2/` endpoints. If they're using evolution they might suggest that
`/companies` is going away, and you should start to work with
`/accounts` instead. The suggestions here may come in the form of
low-tech announcements, but they can also be communicated in-band.

=== Deprecated Endpoints

A HTTP standard was created to solve this: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8594[RFC 8594: Sunset Header]

APIs can add a simple header to the HTTP response, to let clients know the
endpoint is nearing the end of its life.

Supporting Sunset is as simple as sniffing for the `sunset` header, and
it contains a https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#name-date-time-formats[HTTP
date] which looks a little like this:

....
Sunset: Sat, 31 Dec 2018 23:59:59 GMT
....

The standard also allows responses to contain a HTTP `link` header, with
`rel=sunset`. The link can be a link to anything, the endpoint replacing it, a
link to some human readable documentation, a blog post, whatever.

Keep an eye out for sunset headers and their accompanying links coming
back in responses your code is getting, and log, or alert, or pass to a
dashboard accordingly. If you are using Ruby or PHP there are already
easy to use middleware for the most popular HTTP clients:

* *PHP:*
https://github.com/hskrasek/guzzle-sunset[hskrasek/guzzle-sunset]
* *Ruby:*
https://github.com/wework/faraday-sunset[wework/faraday-sunset]

Some API gateways like https://tyk.io[Tyk] mentioned building in support while
it was still in draft, and it is going to become far more wide-spread over time.

Another approach commonly used by API providers is to provide SDKs, and
if they are kept up to date they will fling out deprecation warnings
about resources that are going away.

When you get these notifications, check the errors for what to do next,
or go to their documentation to figure it out, or shout at their
customer support for not making it clear what you're meant to be doing
next and they'll do a better job next time.

=== Deprecating Properties

Other than the entire endpoint going away, specific properties _may_
over time be deprecated. This is less common in global versioning as
they would just remove those in the next global version. It is not a
regular occurrence in evolution as they too would just wait until the
creation of a new resource for the concept, but it can happen if a
property absolutely has to go away.

JSON is the main content type in use these days, which does not have a
type system built in. There is no way to mark a JSON field as deprecated
in just JSON, but those using OpenAPI v3.0 or JSON Schema have a `deprecated: true`
keyword.

Clients can check against the spec programmatically, or the API developer teams
can bake warnings into their SDKs; if a client application hits a property the
SDK knows is deprecated, it can fire off deprecation warnings into the logs, or
other reporting systems. Keeping up to date is important, so make sure something
like https://dependabot.io/[Dependabot] or https://greenkeeper.io/[Greenkeeper]
is implemented to keep tabs on dependencies.

== GraphQL

GraphQL pushes hard for evolution in its marketing and most advice in
the ecosystem, which is awesome. They do not have a huge amount of
documentation covering deprecations, and much of it comes from
third-parties like Apollo, but it's certainly possible.

=== Deprecating Types

Instead of endpoints, GraphQL has types. There is no first class support
for deprecating types in GraphQL at the time of writing, so an API
developer is unable to evolve the concept through adding new properties,
a new type will pop up somewhere. A low-tech solution like a blog or
email announcement may be used to communicate this new type, and the
deprecation of the old type, as there is no formal way to do it.

One possible solution is to deprecate all the properties in the type, and mark
in the reason that the whole type is going away.

=== Deprecating Properties

The API provider will add the `@deprecated` keyword to the type:

....
type User {
  name: String @deprecated(reason: "Property 'name' was split into 'firstname' and 'lastname'")
  firstname: String
  lastname: String
}
....

When looking at a GraphQL API through GraphiQL, the documentation that
it autogenerates will show deprecated fields, visually separated from
the other fields (smart!)
