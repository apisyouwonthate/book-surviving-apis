= SDKs

Assuming you've been tasked with integrating with an API, the first
thing to do is look for a Software Development Kit (SDK). An SDK is
basically a fancy term for some code that has been written to make
integration with a third party API easier in a specific programming
language. Often they are released officially by the company in charge of
the API, sometimes they are written by third-parties and released as
open-source.

The use of an SDK defers a lot of the responsibility to the API
developers, as most of the HTTP-level code you would need to write to
interact with their API is done by them. Theoretically, they should
seamlessly take care of authentication, data formats, HTTP errors will
be turned into exceptions, validation will be returned in a useful
format, etc. If that is the case for the specific API you are attempting
to integrate with, then you might be in luck, and able to skip a lot of
this book.

For example, we have not covered how Authentication works yet, and with
a good SDK you would not need to know, or care. You simply grab the
authentication token and put it into the code:

[source,javacript]
----
const stripe = require("stripe")(
  "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2"
);
----

A good SDK will not only obfuscate how things work at a transport layer,
but a bad one might just get in the way and make it harder to work with
than just approaching the API directly. Much like any
library/package/plugin, if it cannot do everything you require, and has
little room for extension, sometimes it is easier to skip it and do
things yourself.

== Ensuring SDK Quality

To use an SDK for the API you are trying to integrate, there needs to be
an SDK for the programming language you are using, and it needs to be
well built. If there is no official SDK, you can search around and to
find an unofficial one.

If you find one, often that can still suffer from not being particularly
good, especially as abandonment is a big problem in open-source. If the
SDK is outdated, it's potentially useless, and might be missing methods
for the resources and endpoints your application might require.

To ensure the SDK is of good quality, check for a few things.

- Does it have unit tests?
- Does it have documentation?
- Is it on GitHub?
- Does it have loads of outstanding issues that are months old?
- Does it have outstanding pull requests with no feedback?

For examples of great SDKs, again, check out
https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries[Twilio], who do a fantastic job at
building SDKs. They have libraries/packages built for C#, Java, Node,
PHP, Python, Ruby, and JavaScript!

Another example is https://stripe.com/docs/api[Stripe], who document
each SDK and its usage separately, with code examples that show how to
carry out certain tasks in those languages.

[source,javacript]
----
const stripe = require("stripe")(
  "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2"
);
stripe.disputes.update(
  "dp_1AfYgX2eZvKYlo2CXQAAqDv7",
  {
    evidence: {
      customer_name: 'Elijah Williams',
      product_description: 'Comfortable cotton t-shirt',
      shipping_documentation: 'file_1BC7qO2eZvKYlo2CREONzM9U'
    }
  },
  function(err, dispute) {
    // asynchronously called
  }
);
----

Another than the evidence tag taking a JavaScript object that matches
the JSON payload to be sent, there is not much HTTP about this cod, and
that's fantastic if you want to just eat the sausage and not learn how
it is made.

Sadly, as mentioned, there is often no SDK, or no good ones, so lets
keep trucking and learning about making these calls yourself.

// TODO before using the sdk check some things
// check # downloads via NPM
// Search issues for outstanding problems with no movement or conversation
// Check for who owns it - Recently, opted out of using one particular tool because it was owned by a big evil telecom company ðŸ¤®
