<h2 id="_introduction">Introduction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Web APIs are just code somebody else wrote, that lives on a server
controlled by somebody else. The acronym API itself stands for
"Application Program Interface", and that’s what it says on the tin: an
interface for interacting with an application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a rather generic term in the world of computer science and
programming, as a Linux command-line utility would consider its command
names and options to be an API, whilst a Java library would also
consider its method names and arguments to be an API.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Essentially it’s all the same concept, but when talking about Web APIs
we’re talking about the utilization of network protocols such as HTTP,
AMQP, etc., and instead of command-line arguments or method parameters,
we’re working with URLs, query string parameters, or chunks of data like
JSON.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal of a Web API is to provide other applications with access to
specific subset of functionality and data that this application owns.
Some APIs are public (anyone can get the weather from
<a href="http://api.weather.gov">api.weather.gov</a>), some are private (it’s
probably tough to get access to JPMorgan Chase’s Enterprise Customers
API), and some are a mixture.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>APIs can give you data for a single-page JavaScript application, handle
payment information so you don’t have to worry about storing credit card
details, post a Facebook status on a users timeline, or share the same
data across a myriad of different devices. Watch that Netflix show on
your Xbox, it’s all good, APIs have you covered.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a long time my job was designing and building APIs, Then it was
coaching and advising other teams how to build APIs. In more recent
years, it has shifted towards helping different teams building different
software interact with each others systems. These are sometimes
architectural concerns, but a lot of it comes down to clients calling
other systems and knowing what to do with the responses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Essentially the role has been making HTTP interactions reliable, warning
people of potential problems like: don’t assume everything is going to
be JSON, normalizing state management into the API instead of having
loads of clients doing subtly different guesswork, how to configure
timeouts to stop half the company’s applications crashing, and improving
performance with smart usage of HTTP caching. This advice seemed like it
should also go into a book, because I’ve learned a substantial amount
from my time working at WeWork.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book aims to help you interact with an API that is already built.
It will explain things from the users perspective, and if you do happen
to be an API developer, this might give you some insight into how users
will be interacting with your API. Everyone wins. That said, if you want
help building fantastic web APIs, this might not be first book you
should read, and instead you should consider picking up a copy of
<a href="http://apisyouwonthate.com"><em>Build APIs You Won’t Hate</em></a>. This is for the
frontend folks, and those building systems that talk to other systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_terminology">Terminology</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>APIs are built by all sorts of folks; maybe another company, some large
like Google or Facebook, startups, governments, or charity
organizations. They could also be coworkers on another team, or another
department, on another floor (or continent). Maybe you built an API
because you’re a full-stack developer who can do frontend and backend!
This whole time we’re going to refer to "them" as the guardians of these
Web API(s), and assume we have little control over the API.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Those writing code that interact with APIs are usually called "API
Clients" or "user agents", and that is usually a frontend application
(browser app, iOS app, Android app, etc.), or it can actually be another
backend application. Backend applications talking to other Web APIs
share a lot of the same properties as a frontend application talking to
another API, so this book is aimed at all of you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Web API, microservice, service, etc, they’re all terms that mean subtly
different things, that are often used interchangeably by some. For the
duration of this book, we’re just going to say API. A micro service, or
a service, will probably have an API, otherwise it’s not doing anything.
So when you see the generic term API, you know we’re talking about a web
API, which might be part of a service, micro service, a gateway to
multiple microservices, or a giant monolithic application with some API
endpoints jammed into it. It’s all the same as far as API interaction is
concerned.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_do_we_really_need_to_read_a_book">Do we really need to read a book?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Integrating an API is meant to be easy, and backend engineers will often
just throw that phrase around without really understanding what they’re
asking from people.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you’ve never integrated with an API then there’s a bit of a learning
curve. Beyond that, there are a lot of things to learn, a lot of
acronyms and jargon, a lot of conflicting advice on StackOverflow, and a
lot of people spouting really bad advice. There are different types of
API (REST, RPC, GraphQL, SOAP), different types of transportation layer,
lots of different errors to understand, and a tricky balancing act to
make your applications both performant and up-to-date with this data
that lives somewhere else. Many people don’t think about HTTP timeouts
or the effects an accidental 10s hang could have on downstream systems.
What happens if the user gets on a subway half way through a
transaction&#8230;&#8203; Even something as simple as an unexpected validation rule
coming back from the API can leave user stuck in a tween-state, with a
blank screen and no way to progress. AGGH!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some of this would be easier if API developers documenting things
extensively, but most of the time you’re lucky to get an out-of-date
Word document called API Documentation-v2-33-January-18-Final.doc.
Sometimes you might have to guess a contract, and that’s no easy feat.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some of these problems are just lessons learned over time, but in the
mean time your application can be suffering all sorts of bug reports,
user complaints, server issues, and who knows what other sort of
production issues. If it’s not as dire as that, there are at least other
sources of confusion that’ll get you spinning your wheels trying to
figure out what to do next. Throughout the 2000s, most of us web
developers were building frontend and the backend in the same
application. The frontend was just whatever HTML the backend decided to
spit out. Frontend developers would design the templates (HTML + data
tags), and the backend would decide which HTML template to show, and
what values to shove into those tags. Go Smarty.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was a simple time, but there was a lot wrong with it. Sharing data
between apps was awful, and the amount of iframe trickery was scary. One
time I was working on an integration where a financial services company
set up a deal to provide the stocks and shares information for the MSN
Money UK homepage. We generated full HTML on our site, (possibly
generated from a CMS that was not expecting this sort of thing), they
read the whole thing, regex replaced some special tags added just for
them, cached it somehow, and shoved their own CSS on it&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was around this time I started blogging about APIs. 🤔</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thankfully we’ve mostly escaped that swamp, and the vast majority of
companies are building APIs first. On the desktop it’s all about
single-page JavaScript applications, with Angular/Ember/React using data
binding to pull down and push back data from a data source, and mobiles
often work very similarly, regardless of if the apps are HTML based or
native. These frontend applications cannot do all that much by
themselves, so they need to hook up to APIs to do <em>something</em>. That
something might be as simple as persisting data to the server, enabling
communications with other users, charging somebodies credit card, etc.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_external_apis">External APIs</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These days most architectures involve at least one external API (an API
built by another company), and that trend is only going to continue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Think about older video games like Rollercoaster Tycoon. They were
developed singlehandedly, by one software developer who could do a bunch
of things. Over time, the expectations for video games have shot up so
much that no one person could ever create the next bestselling video
game singlehandedly. Now there are whole teams of people who work on
physics engines, some folks figure out how to make realistic hair, and
everyone focuses on building their specific modules.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most smaller game studios will skip building their own physics engines
and simply pay the licensing fee to use an existing software, because
they don’t have the human-power to build their own, and it’s probably
cheaper. APIs are very much the same sort of idea. Startups don’t have
time to build their own SMS messaging service, so they just use Twilio.
It’s fantastic, it only takes a few minutes to get started, and it means
that startup can focus on their application, which is going to make the
world a better place through drone-based, underwear folding in-the-home.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If something awfully complex pops up like geocoding, most folks will
just shove Google Maps API in there, or Mapbox API, or OpenStreet Map
API, because generating a standard interface for wildly different
datasets around the globe is a mess, and why waste time on that when
you’ve got underpants to fold!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_breaking_down_the_monolith">Breaking Down the Monolith</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Over the last few years, the rise of the service (or micro service) has
meant you’ll often be working with more than one API. External APIs
might be replaced with internal APIs as your teams grow and ownership
becomes more important, and larger applications can start to become an
unmanageable non-performant mess. This really makes sense for companies
with larger engineering teams, who want to avoid stepping on each others
toes with changes they make. The more services at play, the more complex
everything gets, but a mature, and educated engineering department with
a strong devops culture can eventually learn to manage this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A lot of teams who are just getting started with building services kinda
forget about this integration part, and forget their systems are going
to be used by a myriad of others. As companies grow, other developers
want to start hooking into these data sources, and often the original
developers have moved on. You end up with all these random things
talking to other random things and the architectural diagrams (if kept
up to date) would look like an octopus orgy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These services need to talk to each other intelligently, handle various
types of error, have realistic timeouts, know when to retry, and most
importantly identify themselves, so you don’t end up with a stampeding
herd; with no idea which client is causing it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These services also need frontends, or have one mega dashboard that
handles the UI for many of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of these scenarios is where you probably come in, so with the why
covered, let’s look at how.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_transportation_layers">1. Transportation Layers</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To send anything to or fetch anything from an API, we&#8217;re going to need a
"transport layer" to do it. Transport layers are conceptually about
sending things about over the network, and there&#8217;s a bunch of different
levels with a bunch of different protocols that all sit on top of each
other. Whole books are written about transportation, network protocols,
and all the fun that goes with it, but we&#8217;re going to skim past some of
the stuff that&#8217;s not relevant. If you don&#8217;t care about inside the
sausage, just skip this chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="http://https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">Transmission
Control Protocol (TCP)</a> and
<a href="http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol">User
Datagram Protocol (UDP)</a> provide two means of sending things around. TCP
ensures a packet of data was received, and UDP is a fire and forget
approach that&#8217;s a little quicker due to its blasé approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One implementation of TCP is TCP/IP, also known as the
<a href="http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite">Internet
Protocol Suite</a>. This is a whole bunch of protocols that facilitate the
modern Internet as we know it, so yay for that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TCP/IP facilitates the
<a href="http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">Hypertext
Transportation Protocol (HTTP)</a>, and <em>that</em> is what we care about. HTTP
is an absolutely fantastic resource for API interaction, as it covers so
many fantastic features, that would be just awful to implement from
scratch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ever growing and improving, there have been three versions over the
years. They&#8217;re all huge improvements, that reflect the evolving
requirements of the web, and the needs of those building software for
it. HTTP/1 was pretty standard and expected early-web stuff: a static
HTML page to load of a few links to Word documents or something,
HTTP/1.1 added a bunch of amazing things to make multiple connections
work far quicker (all that CSS/JS/AJAX/etc), and HTTP/2 changes pretty
much everything, turns conventional wisdom on its head, and gives us
powerful functionality like multiplexing, amongst many other things.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Learning about HTTP and utilizing its features to make fantastic
applications can be tough. HTTP is like snowboarding: you can learn the
basics in a very short amount of time, get cocky, and go smashing off at
high speed, until you inevitably break three ribs&#8230;&#8203; At 12 years old,
HTTP seemed rather clear, and I thought I had a grasp on how it worked.
Almost two decades later I&#8217;m still learning about features, headers, and
options, that were either added back then, or by more recent RFCs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are some of the learnings the book will be covering, as HTTP gets
a lot of very undue flak for being "bulky" or "slow", which mostly come
down to us using it incredibly poorly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is not just a book about HTTP however. There are a few other
protocols that are commonly used for building more "real-time" APIs:
<a href="http://https://wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSockets</a> which sit on top
of a single TCP connection, and
<a href="http://https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Message_Queuing_Protocol">Advanced
Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)</a>. Often these two technologies will be
paired with an HTTP API, providing event-driven interactions for an API
that is otherwise mostly just sitting there waiting for you to ask it
(or tell) it stuff.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whilst there are technically others, depending on the sort of work you
are doing, HTTP APIs are probably going to be what you bump into 80-90%
of the time, with WebSockets or AMQP popping up now and then. As such, a
hefty chunk of the book will be covering HTTP APIs.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_http_basics">1.1. HTTP Basics</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To avoid getting all academic and theoretical, learning by doing might
be the way to go with understanding HTTP.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Making your first HTTP query is easy, you just need a HTTP client. Most
programming languages have one built in, but before we get into all of
that, we can just use the command line. If you have curl available you
can do this, otherwise a quick <code>brew install curl</code> will help.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ curl -X GET http://example.com
&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Example Domain&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;
    ...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Right there, we made a request using the GET method (of course -x means
"method"), to the URL <code><a href="http://example.com" class="bare">http://example.com</a></code>, and we got a HTML response. If
this was some JSON, and if we were doing it in a programming language,
we would be off to a reasonable start!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most programming languages come with a HTTP client by default, but often
they are hard to work with and have an interface uglier than a bulldog
chewing a wasp. For example, the backend language PHP has a curl
extension, which is quite time consuming to do anything with, and
therefore most folks use <a href="http://docs.guzzlephp.org/">Guzzle</a> (which
actually wraps curl).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A popular HTTP client for JavaScript is
<a href="http://https://github.com/axios/axios">Axios</a>, which provides
promise-based HTTP interactions. Their README example shows the most
basic of API interactions, and it looks a bit like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>axios.get('https://api.example.org/companies/12345')
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.log(error);
  });</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Quite simply, we are trying to GET the information for whichever company
has the identifier 12345. If it works, the then() is called, otherwise
catch() is called.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Identifiers (IDs) are used to reference companies in a unique way.
Human readable names might not work as two companies in difference
industries might trade under the same name, so an ID helps keep them
unique.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Asking this question of the API is known as the "HTTP Request", and the
success or fail will be determined by the APIs answer, the "HTTP
Response".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The HTTP client is responsible for providing a useful interface between
your programming language, and whatever low-level networking library is
in place to make the actual requests. At the network level, HTTP is a
plain-text protocol that has a request message and response message. A
request has method like GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS (and a
few more), which indicate the sort of request you are making. There&#8217;s
then a host, and a URI, and you need to specify which HTTP version
you&#8217;re talking about.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Axios example above would produce a HTTP request like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>GET /companies/12345 HTTP/1.1
Host: [api.example.org](http://api.example.org)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The response may well be something successful, and we might get JSON
back to play with:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 18 Dec 2018 12:30:00 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Connection: Closed

{"id":12345,"name":"Patagonia","description":"Expensive outdoor clothing saving the world through taking a decent moral stance"}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It could also be a total failure:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Date: Mon, 18 Dec 2018 12:30:00 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Connection: Closed

{"error":"Get off my land!"}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice here the 401 Unauthorized message on the first line. Thanks to
the conventions set up, any HTTP client is going to know that&#8217;s an
error, and Axios will trigger the catch() block for you. Not all HTTP
clients are that well set up by default, and some ask their users to pay
a bit more attention to detail. Instead of being spoon fed the success
or fail, you&#8217;ll need to programatically be aware of the "status code" in
the HTTP response.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_http_methods">1.2. HTTP Methods</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have made a GET request, because they are nice an easy. There are
plenty more methods out there, which all have their own specific meaning
and uses. Some APIs will use more than others, but it&#8217;s important to
learn what is what.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>GET - Fetching things, shouldn&#8217;t cause anything to change on the API
other than maybe some metrics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>POST - Most commonly used for "creating" things in a collection, but
many APIs will use this for anything that changes state</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PUT - An idempotent method that overrides whatever was there with
whatever you send. Maybe nothing was there before, meaning PUT actually
facilitates create <em>and</em> replace</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PATCH - Update just a few fields instead of everything, to avoid two
clients race-condition clobbering data sent from the other</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DELETE - Guess</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HEAD - Like a GET, but only return the headers</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ll ignore the others for now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the API you are talking to calls itself a "REST API", it&#8217;s likely to
use all of those methods. If it calls itself "RPC", it might only use
GET and POST. If it&#8217;s GraphQL, it&#8217;s all going to happen over POST.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Confused? I know. More on all of that later.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_http_status_codes">1.3. HTTP Status Codes</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A status code is a category of success or failure, with specific codes
being provided for a range of situations, that are essentially metadata
supplementing the body returned from the API. Back in the early 2000s
when AJAX was first a thing, it was far too common for people to ignore
everything other than the body, and return some XML or JSON saying:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>{ "success": true }</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These days it&#8217;s far more common to utilize HTTP properly, and give the
response a status code as defined in the RFC have a number from <code>200</code> to
<code>507</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;with plenty of gaps in between&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and each has a message and a
definition. Most server-side languages, frameworks, etc., default to
<code>200 OK</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Status codes are grouped into a few different categories:, with the
first number being an identifier of the category of thing that happened.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_2xx_is_all_about_success">1.3.1. 2xx is all about success</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whatever your application tried to do was successful, up to the point
that the response was sent. A 200 OK means you got your answer, a 201
Created means the thing was created, but keep in mind that a 202
Accepted does not say anything about the actual result, it only
indicates that a request was accepted and is being processed
asynchronously. It could still go wrong, but at the time of responding
it was all looking good so far.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_3xx_is_all_about_redirection">1.3.2. 3xx is all about redirection</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are all about sending the calling application somewhere else for
the actual resource. The best known of these are the <code>303 See Other</code> and
the <code>301 Moved Permanently</code>, which are used a lot on the web to redirect
a browser to another URL. Some folks use a <code>Location</code> header to point to
the content, so if you see a 3xx check for that.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_4xx_is_all_about_client_errors">1.3.3. 4xx is all about client errors</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With these status codes, APIs indicate that the client has done
something invalid and needs to fix the request before resending it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_5xx_is_all_about_service_errors">1.3.4. 5xx is all about service errors</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With these status codes, the API is indicating that something went wrong
in their side. For example, a database connection failed, or another
service was down. Typically, a client application can retry the request.
The server can even specify when the client should retry, using a
<code>Retry-After</code> HTTP header.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_common_status_codes">1.3.5. Common Status Codes</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Arguments between developers will continue for the rest of time over the
exact appropriate code to use in any given situation, but these are the
most important status codes to look out for in an API:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>200 - Generic everything is OK</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>201 - Created something OK</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>202 - Accepted but is being processed async (for a video means
encoding, for an image means resizing, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>400 - Bad Request (should really be for invalid syntax, but some folks
use for validation)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>401 - Unauthorized (no current user and there should be)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>403 - The current user is forbidden from accessing this data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>404 - That URL is not a valid route, or the item resource does not
exist</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>405 - Method Not Allowed (your framework will probably do this for
you)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>409 - Conflict (Maybe somebody else just changed some of this data, or
status cannot change from e.g: "published" to "draft")</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>410 - Data has been deleted, deactivated, suspended, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>415 - The request had a <code>Content-Type</code> which the server does not know
how to handle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>429 - Rate Limited, which means take a breather, sleep a bit, try
again</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>500 - Something unexpected happened, and it is the APIs fault</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>503 - API is not here right now, please try again later</p>

<h3 id="_http_headers">1.4. HTTP Headers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Headers have been mentioned a few times, and they&#8217;re another great
feature for HTTP.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>HTTP headers are meta-data about the request or response, and control
all sorts of things, like the Content Type (is this JSON or XML), or
cache controls (how long should this data be cached for), etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, some APIs accept "form data", as well as JSON. It&#8217;s
important to understand which is being sent by default, and which the
API wants.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sending form data might look like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>var querystring = require('querystring');
var instance = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'https://api.example.com/',
  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'}
});
instance.post('/hello', querystring.stringify({someParam: 'Some value'));</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sending the same data as JSON might look a little more like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>var instance = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'https://api.example.com/',
  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
});
instance.post('/hello', JSON.stringify({someParam: 'Some value'));</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice the only real difference here is that we have changed the
Content-Type, and changed how we generate the string. HTTP APIs are very
flexible in this way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some APIs will let you request data in a format relevant to your needs:
CSV, YAML, or other more complex binary formats, which we&#8217;ll get into
later. You simply need to supply the
<a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type">media type</a>, and if the API has it
you&#8217;ll get it back.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>var instance = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'https://api.example.com/',
  headers: {'Accept': 'application/csv'}
});
instance.get('/reports/123');</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you try requesting a media type that the API has not defined, you
will probably end up with a
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.6">406 Not Acceptable</a>
response.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Headers can do a whole lot more than just switch content types, but we
will look at relevant headers in relevant content as we go.</p>

<h4 id="_playing_around_with_http">1.4.1. Playing around with HTTP</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mucking about with a HTTP client in a console, like <code>node -i</code> or <code>ruby
console</code> will get you quite a long way, and you can get a feel for how
your programing language HTTP client of choice is going to work. It can
be a little fiddly working that way to get started though, and when
often you will find that a HTTP client with a GUI will be more helpful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are plenty of HTTP GUI applications out there, but the three
biggest are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a></p>

<li>
<p><a href="http://insomnia.rest/">Insomnia</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These GUIs are very impressive, and can help you build complex requests
without having to try to write a bunch of JSON by hand every time. Often
attempting to integrate with a new API via one of these tools first is a
good way to make sure things work as you expect, then it can be
integrated in code.</p>

<h2 id="_sdks">2. SDKs</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assuming you&#8217;ve been tasked with integrating with an API, the first
thing to do is look for a Software Development Kit (SDK). An SDK is
basically a fancy term for some code that has been written to make
integration with a third party API easier in a specific programming
language. Often they are released officially by the company in charge of
the API, sometimes they are written by third-parties and released as
open-source.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The use of an SDK defers a lot of the responsibility to the API
developers, as most of the HTTP-level code you would need to write to
interact with their API is done by them. Theoretically, they should
seamlessly take care of authentication, data formats, HTTP errors will
be turned into exceptions, validation will be returned in a useful
format, etc. If that is the case for the specific API you are attempting
to integrate with, then you might be in luck, and able to skip a lot of
this book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, we have not covered how Authentication works yet, and with
a good SDK you would not need to know, or care. You simply grab the
authentication token and put it into the code:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-javacript" data-lang="javacript">const stripe = require("stripe")(
  "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2"
);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A good SDK will not only obfuscate how things work at a transport layer,
but a bad one might just get in the way and make it harder to work with
than just approaching the API directly. Much like any
library/package/plugin, if it cannot do everything you require, and has
little room for extension, sometimes it is easier to skip it and do
things yourself.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_ensuring_sdk_quality">2.1. Ensuring SDK Quality</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To use an SDK for the API you are trying to integrate, there needs to be
an SDK for the programming language you are using, and it needs to be
well built. If there is no official SDK, you can search around and to
find an unofficial one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you find one, often that can still suffer from not being particularly
good, especially as abandonment is a big problem in open-source. If the
SDK is outdated, it&#8217;s potentially useless, and might be missing methods
for the resources and endpoints your application might require.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To ensure the SDK is of good quality, check for a few things.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Does it have unit tests?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does it have documentation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it on GitHub?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does it have loads of outstanding issues that are months old?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does it have outstanding pull requests with no feedback?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For examples of great SDKs, again, check out
<a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries">Twilio</a>, who do a fantastic job at
building SDKs. They have libraries/packages built for C#, Java, Node,
PHP, Python, Ruby, and JavaScript!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another example is <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api">Stripe</a>, who document
each SDK and its usage separately, with code examples that show how to
carry out certain tasks in those languages.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-javacript" data-lang="javacript">const stripe = require("stripe")(

<p>Another than the evidence tag taking a JavaScript object that matches
the JSON payload to be sent, there is not much HTTP about this cod, and
that&#8217;s fantastic if you want to just eat the sausage and not learn how
it is made.</p>

<p>Sadly, as mentioned, there is often no SDK, or no good ones, so lets
keep trucking and learning about making these calls yourself.</p>

<h2 id="_rpc_rest_and_graphql">3. RPC, REST and GraphQL</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before getting too much further, understanding the differences between
these difference concepts is going to be vital. Every API in the world
is following some sort of paradigm, whether it knows it or not. They
will fall under RPC, REST, or a "query language."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even if you are confident you understand the difference, do yourself a
favor and read them anyway. About 99% of people get this wrong, so you
can get be in the top 1% with a quick read.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_remote_procedure_call_rpc">3.1. Remote Procedure Call (RPC)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RPC is the earliest, simplest form of API interaction. It is about
executing a block of code on another server, and when implemented in
HTTP or AMQP it can become a Web API. There is a method and some
arguments, and that is pretty much it. Think of it like calling a
function in JavaScript, taking a method name and arguments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>POST /sayHello HTTP/1.1
HOST: api.example.com
Content-Type: application/json
{"name": "Racey McRacerson"}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In JavaScript, we would do the same by defining a function, and later
we&#8217;d call it elsewhere:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>/* Signature */
function sayHello(name) {
  // ...
}
/* Usage */
sayHello("Racey McRacerson");</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The idea is the same. An API is built by defining public methods; then,
the methods are called with arguments. RPC is just a bunch of functions,
but in the context of an HTTP API, that entails putting the method in
the URL and the arguments in the query string or body.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When used for CRUD, RPC is just a case of sending up and down data
fields, which is fine, but one downside is that the client is entirely
in charge of pretty much everything. The client must know which methods
(endpoints) to hit at what time, in order to construct its own workflow
out of otherwise incredibly naive and non-descriptive endpoints.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RPC is merely a concept, but that concept has a lot of specifications,
all of which have concrete implementations:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC">XML-RPC</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC">JSON-RPC</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">Simple Object Access Protocol
(SOAP)</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>XML-RPC and JSON-RPC are not used all that much other than by a minority
of entrenched fanatics, but SOAP is still kicking around for a lot of
financial services and corporate systems like
<a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_quickstart_intro.htm">Salesforce</a>.
XML-RPC was problematic, because ensuring data types of XML payloads is
tough. In XML, a lot of things are just strings, which JSON does
improve, but has trouble differentiating different data formats like
integers and decimals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You need to layer metadata on top in order to describe things such as
which fields correspond to which data types. This became part of the
basis for SOAP, which used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_schema">XML
Schema</a> and a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language">Web
Services Description Language (WSDL)</a> to explain what went where and
what it contained.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This metadata is essentially what most science teachers drill into you
from a young age: "label your units!" The sort of thing that stops
people paying $100 for something that should have been $1 but was just
marked as "price: 100" which was meant to be cents&#8230;&#8203; It is also worth
pointing out if your "distance" field is metric or imperial, to avoid
bad math crashing your billion dollar satellite into Mars.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A modern RPC implementation is <a href="https://grpc.io/">gRPC</a>, which can easily
be considered modern (and drastically better) SOAP. It uses a data
format called <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">Protocol
Buffers</a> (or Protobuff for short), which requires a schema as well as
the data instance, much like the WSDL in SOAP. GRPC focuses on making
single interactions as quick as possible, thanks to HTTP/2, and the fact
that Protobuff packs down smaller than JSON. Fear not, JSON is available
for as an option too.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_representational_state_transfer_rest">3.2. Representational State Transfer (REST)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>REST is a network paradigm described by Roy Fielding in
<a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">a
dissertation</a> in 2000. REST is all about a client-server relationship,
where server-side data are made available through representations of
data in simple formats. This format is usually JSON or XML but could be
anything.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These representations portray data from various sources as simple
"resources", or "collections" of resources, which are then potentially
modifiable with actions and relationships being made discoverable via a
concept known as hypermedia controls (HATEOAS).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hypermedia is fundamental to REST, and is essentially just the concept
of providing "next available actions", which could be related data, or
in the example of an "Invoice" resource, it might be a link to a
"Payment Attempts" collection so that the client can attempt paying the
invoice. These actions are just links, but the idea is the client knows
that an invoice is payable by the presence of a "pay" link, and if that
link is not there it should not show that option to the end user.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>{
  "data": {
    "type": "invoice",
    "id": "093b941d",
    "attributes": {
      "created_at": "2017-06-15 12:31:01Z",
      "sent_at": "2017-06-15 12:34:29Z",
      "paid_at": "2017-06-16 09:05:00Z",
      "status": "published"
    }
  },
  "links": {
    "pay": "https://api.acme.com/invoices/093b941d/payment_attempts"
  }
}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is quite different to RPC. Imagine the two approaches were
answering the phones for a doctors office:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Client:</strong> Hi, I would like to speak to Dr Watson, is he there? If so,
what time can I see him and what location.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>RPC:</strong> No. <strong>click</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Calls back</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Client:</strong> I checked his calendar, and it looks like he is off for the
day. I would like to visit another doctor, and it looks like Dr Jones is
available at 3pm, can I see her then?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>RPC:</strong> Yes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The burden of knowing what to do is entirely on the client. It needs to
know all the data, come to the appropriate conclusion itself, then has
to figure out what to do next. REST however presents you with the next
available options:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Client:</strong> Hi, I would like to speak to Dr Watson, is he there? <strong>REST:</strong>
Doctor Watson is not currently in the office, he&#8217;ll be back tomorrow,
but you have a few options. If it&#8217;s not urgent you could leave a message
and I&#8217;ll get it to him tomorrow, or I can book you with another doctor,
would you like to hear who is available today? <strong>Client:</strong> Yes, please let
me know who is there! <strong>REST:</strong> Doctors Smith and Jones, here are links to
their profiles. <strong>Client:</strong> Ok, Doctor Jones looks like my sort of Doctor,
I would like to see them, let&#8217;s make that appointment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>REST:</strong> Appointment created, here&#8217;s a link to the appointment details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>REST provided all of the relevant information with the response, and the
client was able to pick through the options to resolve the situation. Of
course REST would needed to know to look for <code>"status: unavailable"</code> and
follow the <code>other_doctors</code> link to
<code><a href="https://api.doc.io/available_doctors?available_at=2017-01-01" class="bare">https://api.doc.io/available_doctors?available_at=2017-01-01</a> 03:00:00
GMT</code>, but that is far less of a burden on the client than forcing it to
check the calendar itself, ensure it&#8217;s getting timezones right when
checking for availability for that time, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This centralization of state into the server has benefits for systems
with multiple different clients who offer similar workflows. Instead of
distributing all the logic, checking data fields, showing lists of
"Actions", etc. around various clients - who might come to different
conclusions - REST keeps it all in one place.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other than hypermedia (the most powerful yet most ignored part) there
are a few other requirements for a system to be a REST API:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>REST must be stateless: not persisting sessions between requests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Responses should declare cacheablility: helps your API scale if
clients respect the rules</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>REST focuses on uniformity: if you&#8217;re using HTTP you should utilize
HTTP features whenever possible, instead of inventing conventions</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal of these constraints is to make the REST architecture help APIs
last for decades, which is almost impossible to do without these
concepts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>REST also does not require the use of schema metadata, which many API
developers hated in SOAP. For a long time nobody was building REST APIs
with schema, but these days it is far more common thanks to
<a href="http://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a> (inspired by XML Schema but not
functionally identical). This optional layer is something we will talk
about a lot, as it can provide some incredibly functionality like
client-side validation, that was defined by the backend!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, REST became a marketing buzzword for most of 2006-2014.
It became a metric of quality that developers would aspire to, fail to
understand, then label as REST anyway, so most systems saying they are
REST are little more than RPC with HTTP verbs and pretty URLs. As such,
you might not get cacheability provided, it might have a bunch of wacky
conventions, and there might not be any links for you to use to discover
next available actions. These APIs are jokingly called RESTish by people
aware of the difference.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the flip side, a REST API can be used in an RPC fashion if you as the
client developer chose to ignore the links. It is not advisable of
course, but it is possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A huge source of confusion for people with REST is that they do not
understand "all the extra faffing about" such as hypermedia controls and
HTTP caching. They do not see the point, and many consider RPC to be the
almighty. To them, it is all about executing the remote code as fast
possible, but REST (which can still absolutely be performant) focuses
far more on longevity and reduced client-coupling. I like to think of
REST as a state machine operating over a network.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>REST can theoretically work in any transportation protocol that provides
it the ability to fulfill the constraints, but no transportation
protocol other than HTTP quite has the functionality to do so. To fit
REST into AMQP, you would need to define hypermedia controls somehow
(potentially an array of messages you could call next), a standard for
declaring cacheability of the AMQP messages, etc., and create a lot of
tooling that does not exist to implement that cacheing. Basically REST
is too powerful for other existing transportation protocols, so it is
generally implemented in HTTP.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>REST has no specification which is what leads to some of this confusion,
nor does REST have any concrete implementations. That said, there are
two large popular specifications which provide a whole lot of
standardization for REST APIs that chose to use them:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.odata.org/">OData</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://jsonapi.org/">JSON-API</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the API advertises itself as using these, you are off to a good
start. These are more than just standardized shapes for the JSON, they
have guides on pagination, metadata, manipulating relationships between
existing items, etc. Find an OData client or a JSON-API client in
programming language to save yourself some work. Otherwise go at it
yourself with a plain-old HTTP client and you should be ok with a little
bit of elbow grease.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_graphql">3.3. GraphQL</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Listing GraphQL as a direct comparison to these other two concepts is a
little odd, as GraphQL is essentially RPC, with a lot of good ideas from
the REST/HTTP community tacked in. Still, it is one of the fastest
growing API ecosystems out there, mostly due to some of the confusion
outlined above.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GraphQL is basically RPC with a default procedure providing a query
language, a little like SQL - if that is something you are familiar
with. You ask for specific resources and specific fields, and it will
return that data in the response.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/graphql-query.png%20width=714px%20height=194px" alt="image">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It has Mutations for creates, updates, deletes, etc. and again they are
exactly RPC.</p>

<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/graphql-mutations.png%20width=715px%20height=272px" alt="image">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GraphQL has many fantastic features and benefits, which are all bundled
in one package, with a nice marketing site. If you are trying to learn
how to make calls to a GraphQL API, the <a href="http://graphql.org/learn/">Learn
GraphQL</a> documentation will help, and their site has a bunch of other
resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Seeing as GraphQL was built by Facebook, who had previously built a
RESTish API, they&#8217;re familiar with various REST/HTTP API concepts. Many
of those existing concepts were used as inspiration for GraphQL
functionality, or carbon copied straight into GraphQL. Sadly a few of
the most powerful REST concepts were completely ignored.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The backstory to GraphQL, is an interesting one. Facebook has
experimented with various different approaches to sharing all their data
between apps over the years; remember FQL? Executing SQL-like syntax
over a GET endpoint was a bit odd.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>GET /fql?q=SELECT%2Buid2%2BFROM%2Bfriend%2BWHERE%2Buid1%3Dme()&amp;access_token=...</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Facebook got a bit fed up with having a RESTish approach to get data,
and then having the FQL approach for more targeted queries as well, as
they both require different code. As such, GraphQL was created as a
middle-ground between endpoint-based APIs and FQL, the latter being an
approach most API developers would never consider --- or want.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the end, they developed this RPC-style query language system, to
ignore most of the transportation layer, meaning they had full control
over the concepts. Endpoints are gone, resources declaring their own
cacheability is gone, the concept of the uniform interface (as REST
defines it) is obliterated, which has the supposed benefit of making
GraphQL so incredibly simple it could fit into AMQP or any other
transportation protocol.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main selling point of GraphQL is that it defaults to providing the
very smallest response from an API, as you are requesting only the
specific bits of data that you want, which minimizes the Content
Download portion of the HTTP request. It also reduces the number of HTTP
requests necessary to retrieve data for multiple resources, known as the
"HTTP N+1 Problem" that has been a problem for API developers through
the lifetime of HTTP/1.1, but thankfully was solved quite nicely in
HTTP/2.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sadly despite being a rather nice package, GraphQL through Mutations
force the responsibility onto clients to know everything. The only
difference between RPC and GraphQL is the ability to request which
fields you get on a successful mutation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Client:</strong> Hi, I would like to see Dr Watson, and if he is there, what
time can I see him and what location?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>RPC:</strong> No. <strong>click</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Calls back</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Client:</strong> I checked his calendar, and it looks like he is off for the
day. I would like to visit another doctor, and it looks like Dr Jones is
available at 3pm, can I see her then? If so, what time can I see him and
what location.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>RPC:</strong> Yes. 2pm at the Soho Office</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That is a handy feature as it saves a tiny bit of network bandwidth, but
again the client was forced to figure out its own workflow instead of
being presented with a plethora of potential next actions. This sort of
thing makes GraphQL very nice for fetching custom reports, gathering
statistics, etc, somewhat passable at CRUD, but not particularly good
for much else. Despite that it is regularly used for APIs that would be
better suited as REST, so expect to bump into it now and then.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you do bump into GraphQL, you will not be able to use your regular
HTTP clients, and most of things you do with any other HTTP API will not
work here, with GraphQL instead requiring its own special client tools.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_skinnyfat_clients">3.3.1. Skinny/Fat Clients</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is one more piece of theory we need to get our heads around to
really understand the differences between these API paradigms/concepts.
In couples dancing there is usually one person leading, and another
person following. The leader will be in charge of signaling when moves
should be made, and the follower follows their hints. In REST the idea
is that the server leads. In all forms of RPC (including GraphQL), the
client leads.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We already spoke about REST "normalizing state", which is the concept of
removing the guesswork and decision making on things that the server is
authoritative on. The client application in a REST API becomes a thin
UI, which handles user interactions, forms, validations, rendering,
animations, but very little business logic. That is the theory anyway. A
lot of RESTish/RPC/GraphQL APIs force the clients to figure out things
they should not be trying to figure out, as their main interest is
trying to send as little data as possible.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_inferring_state_from_arbitrary_fields">3.4. Inferring State from Arbitrary Fields</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the day job, an upstream API decided originally suggested that
clients should check for <code>location_uuid == nil</code> to infer the membership
type as an "Anywhere member" (a member who can access any of our
coworking specs. One day they changed the logic, suggesting clients
check for location_uuid == "some-special-uuid". This was not
communicated to the developers in charge of various systems as nobody
remembered which of the 50+ systems were making the check. One outcome
of that was to confuse the permissions API, which started denying things
it should not have been denying. Who even knows what else broke and what
else was fixed by various teams working on various systems. Applications
need to be investigated, fixed, and updated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Inferring meaning from arbitrary fields can lead to production issues,
angry users, and wasted developer time debugging bizarre things. The
preferred approach in many of these situations would be to have the
current state normalized on the server with a simple field like "type"
which could have a few options like "anywhere", "other", and the API can
figure out when to display that. If the API you are working with asks
you to infer state of some random fields, politely let them know that
you don&#8217;t want their laziness to break your client application. Request
they provide their data in a useful generic fashion, so the clients
don&#8217;t need to guess everything.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_available_actions">3.5. Available Actions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Working out the current state is bad enough, but working out what to do
"next" when you have a record can be really tough. For example, a
ReactJS application at work had loads of awful helper functions to work
out which "actions" to show next to a list of users in a company
(through the joining resource known as seats).</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>IsNotPrimaryOfAnotherCompany(user, company_uuid) {

    s.kind == "Licensee" &amp;&amp;
    s.company.status == "active";
  }).isEmpty();

<p>The users and company resources have status, and seats has a kind, so
this is somewhat ok, but the client is still working really hard for
this seemingly complex, but potentially simple functionality. Business
logic states that users should not be primary members of more than one
company at the time, so a rule was made in the user management interface
to hide the "Make Primary Member" option if they were. That seems
reasonable enough, but when the iOS native codebase forgot to add that
<code>s.status == "active";</code> condition, the two devices were showing
different actions. We fixed it on iOS, and a few months later another
rule was added to the JavaScript code, causing an unexpected difference
that regression tests did not catch&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The "skinny server, fat client" approach is forcing the client to
download all the seats, and the user information, and the company, just
to spin through all the records and establish if the user can or cannot
see a "Make Primary Member" button&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most basic thing to do for RPC would be to make a "can_be_promoted"
boolean field, which would contain all of the logic internally. The API
is a far better at handling this, it&#8217;ll do it more performantly, and it
will be able to change its own ruling internally whilst still
communicating the same meaning. Try requesting that from the API
developers, and who knows you might get lucky. The REST approach would
be to normalize hypermedia controls (HATEOAS), to also normalize that
state up into the server. If the API was using a format like Siren, you
might see a link nicknamed "promote" for employees, and "demote" for
primary members. The client application could then easily be trained to
recognize the promote/demote links and show the appropriate buttons.
Siren would also handily show the metadata (URI, method, fields, etc.)
required for the client to make the change.</p>

<h3 id="_you_cannot_always_be_a_skinny_client">3.6. You Cannot Always Be a Skinny Client</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Neither approach is definitely good or bad in their entirety, it&#8217;s
simply the case that skinny clients have fewer chances of
misrepresenting the state if they are given the answers explicitly.
Whenever clients try to copy the business logic rules, the chance of
different clients inferring things differently increases. Different
codebases will guess things differently, some will notice changes and
others won&#8217;t, and the need to deploy multiple clients in unison becomes
a lot more common. It also generally leads to having a disparent user
experience across different devices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Letting the server take control of such things can be a little scary,
and it also depends on the relationship the client has with the API, the
team developing it, and the intent of the client application. If the API
is a third-party, letting them lead could cause some unexpected results.
If the API was designed without the knowledge of the clients
requirements, the API might not do a very good job of leading.</p>

<h2 id="_authentication">4. Authentication</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Generally the idea of Authentication is to require that clients provide
some sort of unique information, with the goal of proving the request is
coming from a user or application that actually exists, and is allowed
to make that request. The unique information is usually referred to as
"credentials" and these will be given to you by developers on the team
in charge of the API. If the API belongs to another company you can
often sign up for "API Access" or "API Keys" on their website somewhere.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Authentication primarily allows APIs to restrict access to various
endpoints, but it also offers APIs the chance to track users, give
endpoints user context (GET /feed should only return the <em>current users</em>
feed), filter data, or even throttle and deactivate accounts that overdo
it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some are completely public with no keys at all. Completely open APIs
with no keys seem to be getting rarer over time, as APIs get more
important, do far more, and are increasingly dynamic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To get the specifics for a particular API, their documentation is a
fantastic place to start. Usually API documentation will contain an
"Authentication" section in their docs, and this will usually be towards
the start.</p>

<p>What confuses many folks when faced with HTTP Authentication, is that
most of the time the authentication happens on every single HTTP
request.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That is right: Every. Single. Request.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This sounds bizarre at first, as we are so often used to the concept of
"Users logs in, then they have a session and can do logged in stuff
until they log out or the session expires" being the one paradigm for
how users login. That paradigm certainly exists for some APIs, but its
rare, and for plenty of good reasons.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To cut a long story short, servers are happier when they do not need to
remember who a specific user is. For example, if the API actually has
multiple application servers all running behind load balancers, a client
could hit a different server with each request they make. If cookies
were used, then the user would be logged out every time the load
balancer routed them to a different application server, unless it went
to the trouble of maintaining "sticky sessions" to keep the user hitting
the same server. That is all well and good until that application server
is replaced by another instance on deployment&#8230;&#8203; should users really be
logged out due to a deployment?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For this, and many other reasons (like not having to worry about
logouts), HTTP Authentication tokens are passed on every single request
made.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Stripe have already mentioned HTTP Basic Auth and Bearer, which are two
very similar approaches to authentication in HTTP. There are quite a
damn lot of authentication strategies you could bump into, and whilst
you do not need to know them all, you will probably want to read the

<h3 id="_basic">4.1. Basic</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Digest is an approach to authentication similar to Basic, but is designed to improve on the security concerns.
Instead of transmitting passwords in plain text, it will calculate a MD5 hash and send that. Unlike the
Base64-based passwords used in the basic auth, MD5 is a one-way hash meaning you cannot simply take the hash
and calculate the original password without trying out a lot of different combinations.
&gt; HA1 = MD5(A1) = MD5(username:realm:password)
&gt; HA2 = MD5(A2) = MD5(method:digestURI)
&gt; response = MD5(HA1:nonce:HA2)
The <code>nonce</code> is a unique number, which can contain (but should not be only) a timestamp. This helps to avoid
replay attacks as the same hash will not be usable later on.
<strong>Pros</strong>
* Password is not transmitted in plain text
* The use of <code>nonce</code> helps negate rainbow table attacks
* Generally speaking, more secure than basic auth
* Easier to implement than some approaches
<strong>Cons</strong>
* Harder than basic auth to implement <strong>well</strong>
* Easy to implement badly
* Still insecure over HTTP
* Just like basic auth, passwords can still be stored by the browser
* Uses MD5

MD5 is well accepted by many people today to be extremely crackable in most scenarios. Digest authentication has
not improved since its creation in 1993. While the calculation process should help negate many of
these issues, a lousy implementation of digest authentication will be open to some weird attack vectors that will
remain unknown until after the fact.
Digest is certainly more secure than basic. It is great over SSL - definitely a good choice for an internal API
if you have more time to spend implementing - but it still requires the username and password to be sent repeatedly,
meaning it <em>is</em> potentially hackable if the hacker has enough encrypted requests available to process.</p>

<h3 id="_oauth_1a">4.3. Oauth 1a</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not quite as popular these days, OAuth 1.0a was a big player on the web-based authentication scene and used by
services such as Dropbox, Flickr, Twitter, Google, LinkedIn and Tumblr. Since then, most have moved over to OAuth 2,
which we will discuss next. The two are very different beasts and should not be conflated.
&gt; OAuth provides a method for clients to access server resources on
&gt; behalf of a resource owner (such as a different client or an end-user).
&gt; It also provides a process for end-users to authorize third-party access
&gt; to their server resources without sharing their
&gt; credentials (typically, a username and password pair), using user-agent redirections.
&gt;&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;<strong>Source:</strong> [Wikipedia](<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth" class="bare">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth</a>)
Previously, we looked at authentication technologies that were essentially built into the browser, and were
not particularly flexible in their usages. OAuth 1.0 was a great way for services such as social networks to
implement web-based HTML login forms that looked the same as any other login form (were branded with logos,
color schemes, etc) but could then send you back to the third party website for all sorts of awesome
integration purposes.
For example, when Twitter swapped from HTTP Basic integration to OAuth 1.0 it meant that instead of
third-parties (iPhone apps, other websites, CMSs, whatever) asking end-users to enter their username and
password (which would be saved somewhere in plain text), the third party could redirect the user to the Twitter
website, get them to log in, and have them come back to their service to save a special token, instead of saving a
password. OAuth 1.0a called these tokens an 'OAuth Token' and an 'OAuth Token Secret'.
OAuth 1.0a was built to be very secure even when not running over SSL. That meant, of course, that it was
incredibly complicated, having to set up signatures of which there were a few different algorithms, including
HMAC-SHA1 and RSA-SHA1, or just plaintext. That got a bit tricky when trying to write client code, as you had to
make sure you supported the right signature algorithm, and most of the PHP implementations out there (including
my old CodeIgniter library) did not support them all.
An average OAuth 1.0a signed HTTP request would look a little something like this:
<sub>~</sub><sub>~</sub>~~
POST /moments/1/gift HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.org
Authorization: OAuth realm="http://sp.example.org/",
oauth_consumer_key="0685bd9184jfhq22",
oauth_token="ad180jjd733klru7",
oauth_signature_method="HMAC-SHA1",
oauth_signature="wOJIO9A2W5mFwDgiDvZbTSMK%2FPY%3D",
oauth_timestamp="137131200",
oauth_nonce="4572616e48616d6d65724c61686176",
oauth_version="1.0"
Content-Type: application/json
{ "user_id" : 2 }
<sub>~</sub><sub>~</sub>~~
Ouch.
Another complication was that there were different implementations: two-legged ("proper" and "not proper") and
three-legged. This is incredibly confusing, so I will let Mashape explain in the [OAuth Bible: OAuth Flows].
There was also xAuth (which is still OAuth 1.0a), designed for mobile and desktop applications that do
not have easy access to a browser. It is much easier for a web application to spawn a popup with JavaScript, or to
redirect a user, than it is for a mobile app. This made it a much handier way to get OAuth Tokens than the other
implementations.
In the end, if you got the OAuth Token and Secret, you would place the OAuth Token in the request as a
header and use the secret to sign the signature, which would encrypt the request and make the whole thing nice
and secure. If you can shove SSL on top of that, then you have got yourself a very secure setup - except for the
fact that tokens would stay the same once created, so over time their security could be compromised. Somebody
could recover the data from a laptop you sold them on eBay, or a potential hacker could packet sniff enough
traffic signed with your signature to eventually programmatically guess the token and secret.
<strong>Pros</strong>
* Super secure, even without SSL
* Does not send username/password in every request (plain text or hashed)
* Stops third party applications wanting or storing your username and password
* An attacker gaining an OAuth Token and even a Secret should still never be able to change your password, meaning you should be safe from account hijack
<strong>Cons</strong>
* Rather complicated to interact with, even if you have a well built client library. PHP never really had one, but [The League of Extraordinary Packages](<a href="http://thephpleague.com/" class="bare">http://thephpleague.com/</a>) has recently [built a decent one](<a href="https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth1-client" class="bare">https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth1-client</a>)
* Limited number of ways to grant access. xAuth and Two/Three-legged flows ended up being rather restrictive
* Tokens never changed, so security was essentially just a matter of how long and how much you used the service
OAuth 1.0a would be a great technology to implement if you were building a website with a public user-based API&#8230;&#8203; and you were building it in 2009-2010. Now, probably not.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_oauth_2">5. OAuth 2</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OAuth 2 dropped the secret token, so users are simply getting an <em>access token</em> now. It also dropped signature
encryption. This was seen by many as a massive step backwards in security, but it was actually rather a wise
move. The OAuth 1.0a spec made SSL optional, but OAuth 2.0 requires it. Relying on SSL to handle the encryption
of the request is logical and drastically improves the implementation.
Even a basic GET request in OAuth 1.0a was horrendous as you would always need to set up your consumers,
signatures, etc., but with OAuth 2.0 you can simply do this:
{lang=php,starting-line-number=1}
<sub>~</sub><sub>~</sub>~~
file_get_contents('https://graph.facebook.com/me?access_token=vr5HmMkzlxKE70W1y4Mi');
<sub>~</sub><sub>~</sub>~~
Or, as we saw back in [chapter 3](<mark>chapter-3), you can usually pass access tokens to the server as an HTTP
request header:
<sub>~</sub><sub>~</sub>~~
POST /moments/1/gift HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.org
Authorization: Bearer vr5HmMkzlxKE70W1y4Mi
Content-Type: application/json
{ "user_id" : 2 }
<sub>~</sub><sub>~</sub>~~
That looks a little easier to work with than OAuth 1.0a, right?
W&gt; #</mark># Headers vs. URL
W&gt; You should always try to use the <code>Authorization</code> header to send your tokens whenever possible. The query-string is
W&gt; secured when using SSL, but unless they are intentionally blocked then access tokens could start turning up in server
W&gt; logs and various other places. Also, browsers will store the full URL (including query-string) in history. This could
W&gt; easily compromise the integrity of users security if their computer is stolen or if a sibling decides to play a prank.
<strong>"Short"-life Tokens</strong>
As discussed, OAuth 1.0a also uses the same tokens essentially forever. OAuth 2.0&#8217;s access tokens will (can)
expire after an arbitrary period of time, which is defined by the OAuth server. When you request an access token, you will
usually be provided with a <em>refresh token</em> and an <em>expiry offset</em>, which is the number of seconds until the token
expires. Some servers send you a unix time at which it expires. Folks like to do things different for some
reason, but if you know what to look out for it is not so bad.
Using the expire time you know when your access token will not be valid, so you can proactively create a CRON
job that refreshes the access tokens, or you can wrap your HTTP requests in an exception handler that looks for
a 'Not Authorized' error and then refreshes them as the OAuth 2.0 spec recommends.
This extra "access tokens expire and you have to refresh them" step initially seems confusing and annoying,
especially when you are used to "once I have this token it works forever". However, it is much more secure. OAuth 1.0a
stopped you handing out your username and password by essentially giving you another username and password (the
token and the secret), which worked for one specific client. Any good network admin will tell you that you should
regularly change your password (at least once every month), and OAuth is no different as the more you use the same
password/token the greater your chance of somebody finding out what it is.
<strong>Grant Types</strong>
One further massive benefit OAuth 2.0 provides over OAuth 1.0a is the ability to have multiple (even custom) grant
types. Grant types are essentially a "mode" in which the OAuth 2.0 server will run, expecting different inputs and
maybe providing different outputs. With this flexibility, you can create some amazing implementations.
The most common OAuth 2.0 Grant Type that a user will be familiar with is <code>authorization_code</code>, which is a very OAuth
1.0a-like flow.
A client web app creates a link to the OAuth Server of the service they would like to log into (e.g. Facebook), and the
user logs in. Facebook redirects the user back to the client web app&#8217;s 'Callback URL' with a <code>?code=FOO</code> variable in
the query string. The web app then takes that code and makes a second request to Facebook (usually a <code>POST</code>, but sometimes
a <code>GET</code> depending on which popular API you look at) and Facebook then offers up an access token in the response.
Some other popular APIs, like Google Apps, then provide <code>expires</code> and a refresh token too.
This is just one approach and there are more. Due to this flexibility, OAuth 2.0 is good for pretty much any
scenario when authenticating an API, be it a basic username password login on a single-page JavaScript app, a
CRON job that has no database access, or a full blown user-redirect flow between different websites. The flexibility
of custom grant types allows absolutely anything to be done.
More on this in the 'Understanding OAuth 2.0 Grant Types' section below.
<strong>Erin Hammer</strong>
Often, I am asked why anyone would still use OAuth 2.0 after Erin Hammer (lead author and editor of the OAuth 2.0
standard) [withdrew his name from the specification]. It certainly sent a ripple through the Internet, but I
personally disagree wholeheartedly with the issues he raised.
1. OAuth 2.0 is less secure if you do not use SSL/TSL. Correct. So use them.
2. People have implemented OAuth 2.0 badly (looking at you Facebook/Google/most providers), but when implemented well it is lovely. Use a pre-built standard compliant implementation.
3. He thinks refresh tokens are annoying, but I think they are great.
His departure from the project is no major loss. I am sure the IETF are bikeshedding hard,
but after using both for years, I am much happier with OAuth 2.0 and really wish [Twitter would get on with a
full upgrade] so I never have to use OAuth 1.0a again.
<em>Generally speaking,</em> OAuth 2.0 is a good fit for a huge majority of situations, provided you <strong>use SSL</strong> and
implement a <strong>well-tested</strong> existing solution for your OAuth 2.0 Server. Trying to do this yourself can be
incredibly hard and may well lead to you getting super-hacked. Even Facebook
have trouble here to this day because they rolled their own solution based on a really early draft of the
specification.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Going over the wire is fraught with danger, and it gets worse the
farther a request and response have to travel. A common theme "in this
book will be: avoid making network calls when possible, expect failure,
and make sure your user interface degrades to vary levels, so failures
are clear. No white screens of death!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One quick tip: make sure your HTTP client throws exceptions whenever
possible, which makes failures a lot more clear. Some applications
presume the call will work then fall over on JSON parsing, or some other
business logic later down the line which expects an object, but the
object contains some error message and the required keys are missing.
This all makes debugging very complicated as the backtrack will send you
off on some wild goose chase looking at some unrelated source code.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Failed to connect? Try it again, and if it fails a few times maybe show

<p>It&#8217;s important to make sure that no single part of any client
application <em>requires</em> a connection to leave that state. Often I have
seen client applications submit a form, hide the form they just
submitted, fail to make the connection, and as they were expecting a
positive or negative JSON response in a specific structure, in order to
dictate showing the form again or progressing, they end up with a blank
screen.</p>

<p>Timeouts are also a concern, but more on those later.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_rate_limiting">6.2. Rate Limiting</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another common situation to run into is rate limiting: the API telling
you to calm down a bit, and slow down how many requests are being made
in a certain timeframe. The most basic rate limiting strategy is often
"clients can only send X requests per second."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many APIs implement rate limiting to ensure relative stability when
unexpected things happen. If for some reason one client causes a spike
in traffic, the API has to continue running smoothly for other users
instead of crashing. A misbehaving (or malicious script) could be
hogging resources, or the API systems could be struggling and they need
to cut down the rate limit for "lower priority" traffic. Sometimes it is
just because the company providing the API has grown beyond their
wildest dreams, and want to charge money for increasing the rate limit
for high capacity users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Often the rate limit will be associated to an "API key" or "access
token" (see <a href="#authentication">Authentication</a>), and our friends over
at Nordic APIs very nicely explain some other rate limiting strategies:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Server rate limits are a good choice as well. By setting rates on
specific servers, developers can make sure that common use servers, such
as those used to log in, can handle a lot more requests than specialized
or seldom used servers, such as data conversion devices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, the API developer can implement regional data limits, which
limit calls by region. This is especially useful when implementing
behavior-based limiting; for instance, a developer would expect the
number of requests during midnight in North America to be lower than the
baseline daytime rate, and any behavior contrary to this without a good
reason would suggest questionable activity. By limiting the region for a
period of time, this can be prevented. <strong>---</strong>

<p>All fair reasons, but for the client it can be a little pesky.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_throttling_your_api_calls">6.2.1. Throttling Your API Calls</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a lot of ways to go about throttling your API calls, and it
very much depends on where the calls are being made from. One of the
hardest things to limit are API calls to a third party being made
directly to the client. For example, if your iOS/web/etc clients are
making Google Map API calls directly from the application, there is very
little you can do to throttle that. You&#8217;re just gonna have to pay for
the appropriate usage tier for how many users you have.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other setups can be a little easier. If the rate limited API is being
spoken to via some sort of backend process, and you control how many of
those processes there are, you can limit often that function is called
in the backend code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, if you are hitting an API that allows only 20 requests per
second, you could have 1 process that allows 20 requests per second to
pass through. If this process is handling things synchronously that
might not quite work out, and you might need to have something like 4
processes handling 5 requests per second each, but you get the idea.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If this process was being implemented in NodeJS, you could use
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bottleneck">Bottleneck</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>const Bottleneck = require("bottleneck");
 
// Never more than 5 requests running at a time.
// Wait at least 1000ms between each request.
const limiter = new Bottleneck({
  maxConcurrent: 5,
  minTime: 1000
});

const fetchPokemon = id =&gt; {
  return pokedex.getPokemon(id);
};

limiter.schedule(fetchPokemon, id).then(result =&gt; {
  /* ... */

<p>Ruby users who are already using tools like Sidekiq can add plugins like
<a href="https://github.com/sensortower/sidekiq-throttled">Sidekiq::Throttled</a>, or
pay for Sidekiq Enterprise, to get
<a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Ent-Rate-Limiting">rate limiting
functionality</a>. Worth every penny in my books.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every language will have some sort of throttling, job queue limiting,
etc. tooling, but you will need to go a step further. Doing your best to
avoid hitting rate limits is a good start, but nothing is perfect, and
the API might lower its limits for some reason.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_am_i_being_rate_limited">6.2.2. Am I Being Rate Limited?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The appropriate HTTP status code for rate limiting has been argued over
about as much as tabs vs spaces, but there is a clear winner now;
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585">RFC 6585</a> defines it as 429, so APIs
should be using 429.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/429.jpg" alt="image">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Twitter&#8217;s API existed for a few years before this standard, and they
chose "420 - Enhance Your Calm". They&#8217;ve dropped this and moved over to
429, but some others copied them at the time, and might not have updated
since. You cannot rule out bumping into a copycat API, still using that
outdated unofficial status.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/420.jpg" alt="image">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Google also got a little "creative" with their status code utilization.
For a long time were using 403 for their rate limiting, but I have no
idea if they are still doing that. GitHub v3 (a RESTful API that was
replaced with a GraphQL, but is still floating around) <em>is</em> still using
403:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1377013266
{
   "message": "API rate limit exceeded for xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx. (But here's the good news: Authenticated requests get a higher rate limit. Check out the documentation for more details.)",
   "documentation_url": "https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting"
}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Getting a 429 (or a 420) is a clear indication that a rate limit has
been hit, and a 403 combined with an error code, or maybe some HTTP
headers can also be a thing to check for. Either way, when you&#8217;re sure
it&#8217;s a rate limit error, you can move onto the next step: figuring out
how long to wait before trying again.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_proprietary_headers">6.2.3. Proprietary Headers</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Github here are using some proprietary headers, all beginning with
<code>X-RateLimit-</code>. These are not at all standard (you can tell by the
<code>X-</code>), and could be very different from whatever API you are working
with.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Successful requests with Github here will show how many requests are
remaining, so maybe keep an eye on those and try to avoid making
requests if the remaining amount on the last response was 0.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>curl -i https://api.github.com/users/octocat
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 56
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1372700873</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can use a shared key (maybe in Redis or similar) to track that, and
have it expire on the reset provided in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">UTC time</a> in <code>X-RateLimit-Reset</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_retry_after">6.2.4. Retry-After</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>According to the RFCs for HTTP/1.1 (the obsoleted and irrelevant RFC
2616, and the replacement RFC 7230-7235), the header
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.3">Retry-After</a> is only
for 503 server errors, and maybe redirects. Luckily
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585">RFC 6584</a> (the same one which added
HTTP status code 429) says it&#8217;s totally cool for APIs to use
<code>Retry-After</code> there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, instead of potentially infinite proprietary alternatives, you should
start to see something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests

   "documentation_url": "https://developer.example.com/#rate-limiting"
}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An alternative value for Retry-After is an HTTP date:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Retry-After: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Same idea, it just tells the client to wait until then before bothering
the API further.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By checking for these errors, you can catch then retry (or re-queue)
requests that have failed, or if thats not an option try sleeping for a
bit to calm workers down.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>*Warning:* Make sure your sleep does not block your background
processes from processing other jobs. This can happen in languages where
sleep sleeps the whole process, and that process is running multiple

overzealous sleep!</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Faraday, a ruby gem I work with often, is
<a href="https://github.com/lostisland/faraday/pull/773">now aware of
Retry-After</a>. It uses the value to help calculate the interval between
retry requests. This can be useful for anyone considering implementing
rate limiting detection code, even if you aren&#8217;t a Ruby fan.</p>

<h3 id="_error_codes_and_error_messages">6.3. Error Codes and Error Messages</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Error codes are usually strings or integers that act as a unique index
to a corresponding human-readable error message with more information
about what is going wrong. That sounds a lot like HTTP status codes, but
these errors are about application specific things that may or may not
have anything to do with HTTP specific responses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some folks will try to use HTTP status codes exclusively and skip using
error codes because they do not like the idea of making their own error
codes or having to document them, but this is not a scalable approach.
There will be some situations where the same endpoint could easily
return the same status code for more than one different condition. For
example, a 403 could be because the authenticated user is not allowed to
send a message to this specific user, or it could mean the users has
been banned entirely.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>HTTP status codes are there to merely hint at the category of error.
When an API needs to return application specific information, it can do
that with a simple bit of JSON in the response.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, an issue with the access token will always result in the
user not being recognized. An uninterested client would simply say "User
could not get in" while a more interested client would probably prefer
to offer suggestions via messages in their own webapp/iPhone app
interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">

  "error": {
    "type": "OAuthException",
    "message": "Session has expired at unix time 1385243766.
The current unix time is 1385848532."
  }
}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Humans can understand that nicely enough, but this example from an old
version of the Facebook Graph API is not good enough. Their "type" is
vague, making it rather hard for computers to understand the problem.
They have added error codes since then, which removes the hell which is
substring matching a bit of text to find out the specifics of what is
going on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Twitter does a great job of having their
<a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/response-codes.html">error
responses and codes documented</a>. It&#8217;s a good thing they use error codes
on top of HTTP status codes, because they loooooooove to use 403. In the
Twitter API, a 403 response could mean:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The access token being used belongs to a suspended user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The OAuth credentials cannot be validated. Check that the token is
still valid</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thrown when a user cannot follow another user due to some kind of
limit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thrown when a Tweet cannot be viewed by the authenticating user,
usually due to the Tweet&#8217;s author having protected their Tweets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was a duplicated follow request and a previous request was not
yet acknowleged</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a snipped list because I got tired of copying and pasting.
Twitter are misusing 403 for most of those examples past the first, but
they&#8217;ve never much cared about good API design.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyway, if you check their documentation, they have a code next to each

<h2 id="_user_experience_pitfalls">7. User Experience Pitfalls</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Connecting to and using the APIs that enable your application are only
part of the story.  Creating and managing a design that is both
intuitive and useful for the people using your application is critical
to building successful software.  Paradoxically,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetic_usability_effect">science has
shown</a> that if your users <em>perceive</em> your product to be aesthetically
pleasing, they will feel like they&#8217;re using more intuitive (and thus
more valuable) software.  Whether you consider yourself a full-stack
developer, a front-end developer, or a database engineer, it&#8217;s to your
benefit to take advantage of this by understanding where your work fits
into the bigger picture of User Experience design on your team.  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you&#8217;ve figured out how to consume a given API, spend some time
considering all of the ways in which things might go wrong. Within
reason, do your best to utilise user experience patterns which help
users feel empowered when everything is working correctly, and
well-informed when API calls fail.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_progressive_data_presentation">7.1. Progressive Data Presentation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The vast majority of the time, your API will probably be working
perfectly well, but not providing data to your application quickly
enough to be perceived as instant by your users. When a page in your
application appears empty for even a fraction of a second, it can make
your app seem like it is unresponsive, or not working correctly, or just
sluggish.  This is easy to forget when you&#8217;re developing your app on a
beefy workstation - particularly if your dev environment includes your
API, database, and app. You may be seeing imperceptible loading times of
&lt;200ms, but that won&#8217;t be representative of your app&#8217;s typical consumer.
They could be in the middle of nowhere, traveling, underground, or
throttled for some suspect reason (looking at you, <em>AT&amp;T!).</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Perceived loading time is particularly sensitive in the case of people
loading your app on mobile devices - whether through a browser or from a
native app downloaded from their respective app store. These are people
who can experience download speeds that vary wildly from moment to
moment - and honestly, this is something that can be really easy to lose
sight of.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You - <em>you</em> - the developer/designer/maker of this thing, are building
your app in an environment you have some control over. Your home office
or your couch are likely connected to a predictably performant broadband
network. If you work in a traditional office or a coworking space,
high-speed broadband is generally a safe bet, too. Hell, even if you&#8217;re
throwing back $7 lattes while designing and building your app at your
local specialty coffee shop, I&#8217;d bet your connection is pretty damn
good. In <em>any</em> of these cases, if your connection degrades or goes down,
you&#8217;ve very likely got a plan B that your users may not have.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What I want you to do here is close your eyes and imagine yourself using
your app from somewhere else, with a less ideal connection. Maybe you&#8217;re
on a train riding from Brussels to Paris, with a spotty wifi connection
that comes and goes as you fly through the countryside. Maybe you&#8217;re in
a quiet cafe in Vietnam, sipping an iced coffee in the sweltering heat,
connected to a network that makes everything just a bit of a struggle.
 What if you&#8217;re on a mobile phone in the middle of Pune India, on a
crowded 3G Network, or in Midtown NYC where the signal is inexplicably
awful? It can <em>really</em> suck, right? This is something you should
regularly do - even if you don&#8217;t expect the majority of your users to be
in this kind of situation.  You can also use a simulator to slow your
network, like the Chrome devtools
<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/#network">network
throttling utility</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This, of course, begs the question: what can we do to make the page
loading experience better for our users? A good place to start is to
think about experiences you&#8217;ve had with sites and apps that behave badly
when it comes to loading data on a page.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;ve undoubtedly come across a website whose content loads in
unpredictable chunks - with content appearing and unfolding haphazardly
on the page right in front of your eyes, pushing content you were trying
to read down without warning.  This is a step better than the "Web 1.0"
days where you&#8217;d need to wait for <em>everything</em> to load before displaying
any content, but only because there&#8217;s a chance you may be able to get to
what you&#8217;re looking for slightly more quickly.  It&#8217;s tricky business
trying to guess what&#8217;s going on in an app while content is popping into
existence left and right, changing the layout of the page as it arrives
back from its journey through the API.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Think of it this way: you know that one website you use, where you go to
click on the link to [<em>the thing you want to do],</em> but just as you go to
click on it, something on the page loads just above where you&#8217;re about
to click, causing the page to reflow so that you click the <em>[Sign Out]</em>
button instead of that one simple thing you wanted to do?</p>

favorite open-source repositories, you may find community-supported
libraries, packages, and plugins that support this sort of behavior.

<h3 id="_everything_is_a_hierarchy">7.2. Everything is a Hierarchy</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s be clear: while it is easy to discuss, this is <em>not</em> an inherently
straightforward task for a product team (even a one-person team) to
execute on. In my experience, I&#8217;ve found it can be beneficial to start
by dissecting your interface into its hierarchical data components. Put
simply, this means you should break down a given screen into an <em>ordered
list</em> of information on the page. As with many design-related
activities, this is firmly rooted in science.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Spend enough time around seasoned designers, and you&#8217;ll eventually hear
someone prattle on about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow&#8217;s_hierarchy_of_needs">Maslow&#8217;s
Hierarchy of Needs</a>.  If up until this moment you&#8217;ve been lucky enough
to have never encountered Maslow, I can save you some time: from a UX
perspective, the hierarchy tells us that first we should deliver what
the user <em>needs</em> before we give them what they [think they] want.  (In
reality, Maslow tell us quite a bit more than that, but for the sake of
this example, this should be a suitable oversimplification).  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So let&#8217;s come back to the example of dealing with a user on a
particularly slow connection.  Looking at any page or interface as a
hierarchy of data being presented to the user becomes advantageous for
us if we have some idea of what actions a user might be looking to
accomplish on a page.  </p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_first_the_sublime_a_logical_hierarchy">7.2.1. First: The sublime, a Logical Hierarchy</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In practice, this isn&#8217;t difficult to get started on. For a given
interface, make a list of all of the <em>types of information</em> on the
screen. From that list, ask yourself: <em>Which bit of information here is</em>
<strong><em>most</em></strong> <em>important?</em> Do the same thing for all remaining bits of data.
Just like that, you&#8217;ve got a <em>logical hierarchy</em> of the data on your
page. From a User Experience perspective, that&#8217;s really step 1. If
you&#8217;re working with a reasonably well-designed bit of interface, this
hierarchy should be reflected in the design of the page. It&#8217;s very
likely that the single most important thing on a given screen should be
the biggest/boldest thing, and located somewhere near the very top of
the content area of the page.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>image::images/progressive-data-loading.png[For example, if you are showing a
feed of articles, and next to that feed of data are some suggestions for
things to read next, and a list of trending articles, then feed is
probably the primary data, the suggestions might be secondary, and the
service which shares trending articles might be down, so that could be
tertiary.]</p>

<div class="paragraph">

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_then_which_data_is_most_expensive">7.2.2. Then: Which data is most expensive?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you&#8217;ve got your <em>logical hierarchy</em> sorted, it&#8217;s time to take a
realistic look at the types of data that are contained in each layer of
the hierarchy. Some basic analysis of data types should help you figure
out which bits of interface are most expensive to load (in english:
loading images and video take the longest). There&#8217;s no hard and fast
rule for how this should affect the prioritized ordering of data being
loaded on your page. In some situations, you may the main feature image
or video to load first, if that&#8217;s what the person viewing your interface
is most interested in. In other cases, images and video serve more to
add context and richness to a design - in these cases, it may be safe to
delay loading these until more critical information in your hierarchy is
available.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_next_bring_in_the_harsh_realities_of_development">7.2.3. Next: Bring in the harsh realities of development</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point, you&#8217;ll have an idea of the order in which data <em>should</em>
be loaded&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;ideally. You will inevitably find that this isn&#8217;t
technically feasible in all cases. Your APIs may not provide information
granularly enough for you to request just-the-bits-you-want, and that&#8217;s
<em>okay!</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These days there is a big push for flexibility in requests. A lot of
APIs offer you the ability to grab a lot of data all at once, but they
should also let you load just the bits you want. This used to be slow in
a HTTP/1 world, with browsers limiting you to 6 connections to a domain
at any time. Now that you can use HTTP/2, that limit is configurable,
and defaults to about 100 in most browsers, so crack on and make more
connections.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In particular, with GraphQL, this gives you the opportunity to pare your
query down to <em>exactly the data</em> you need for a given view. This give
you the opportunity to consume an API in exactly the ways that you need,
making for extremely efficient data requests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Combining this with the process we discussed for loading information
progressively, you can craft separate queries for each tier of
information you need to display on a given view. This will help ensure
that when a given query comes back, it will contain only the data needed
to hydrate a particular subset of your interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re building your application with a modern framework like Angular
or React, you can suddenly build a custom query for each type or
collection of components loaded onscreen, which can be tweaked as design
or business requirements change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For third-party APIs, you&#8217;ll have to work with what is available to you.
For APIs delivered by your team or organization, this gives you an
opportunity to have a discussion about data delivery strategy. Often
times, when testing early versions of a product, there&#8217;s no sense in
creating APIs <em>or</em> interfaces that work this way. Once your team has
proven the value of what you&#8217;re building, you can revisit the page load
experience to make things feel smoother and more intuitive.</p>

<h3 id="_connectivity">7.3. Connectivity</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many different ways in which your users might lose
connectivity while using your app. If we anticipate what these may be,
given the context of a particular app, we can build interfaces which
convey what&#8217;s gone wrong, and give opportunities or suggestions to
remedy the situation.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_completely_offline">7.3.1. Completely offline</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What happens when your app loses its connection to the internet? When
you detect a loss of connectivity, have a strategy on-hand for
presenting that to your users.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/xqlC7YltuqwQvsUOaLRsCgVxv7BPqUX_CEcm8XeyzIsWwc-5aXsOTT3NMchVhX6Y-30_kShzY2fOZCQmST4RcYfdxLtgX3jXtgNxwtqv2SqB9w2Vs8GIhzIjtiKfCp6UkWLZ-Gyu.png" alt="image">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Intercom provides a helpful notification when users are offline, without
disabling every action on the page.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may also be able to cache actions while your users are offline.
 You&#8217;ve probably experienced this before with your mail client of
choice.  Gmail, Outlook, Thunderbird, and whatever else you might prefer
will let you draft new emails (and replies to existing emails) while
offline.  You can even send them, which puts the email into your outbox,
to be sent as soon as your connection comes back from the dead.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For both web and mobile applications, the strategy for enabling offline
actions is fairly similar - first, make sure the user knows they&#8217;re
offline.  Beyond that, if there are actions that they may reasonably be
able to perform without loading more information from the web - let
them! This generally includes actions where your user is annotating some
content (tagging financial records with metadata, marking an action as
completed), or drafting new content (like writing an email, or drafting
a blog post).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Behind the scenes, those actions will get cached to local storage on the
device using any of a number of techniques, depending on your
implementation.  Once your app detects that connectivity has returned,
the user&#8217;s actions are sent off to your API in the order they were
executed while offline. Once confirmation comes back from the server
that the job is done, data is reloaded on the client-side, and they
should be up to speed!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In web app parlance, this type of behavior is often called a Progressive
Web App (or PWA).  Depending on your implementation details, there are
loads of different ways to accomplish the PWA dream.  For example,
Amazon provides a service called <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/">AWS
AppSync</a> for GraphQL, and Google&#8217;s Firebase has several action caching
strategies built into their framework
(<a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/android/offline-capabilities">Web</a>,
<a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/ios/offline-capabilities">IOS</a>,
and
<a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/android/offline-capabilities">Android</a>).
 Ruby on Rails has a library called
<a href="https://rossta.net/blog/service-worker-on-rails.html">serviceworker-rails</a>,
and ASP.net has an open source library extension called
<a href="https://github.com/madskristensen/WebEssentials.AspNetCore.ServiceWorker">WebEssentials.AspNetCore.ServiceWorker</a>
- all ready for you to dive in and make your users' lives better.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For actions which you&#8217;re unable to cache locally while your users are
offline, disable anything on screen that users won&#8217;t be able to use.
This might not mean you should disable the <em>entire</em> screen. For example,
it is often a good idea to keep Log Out actions available, so that users
on public or shared devices can exit your app locally. On a web app,
this generally means clearing local storage and cookies of any cached
information you&#8217;ve stored - none of which requires a connection to the
internet.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_temporarily_offline">7.3.2. Temporarily offline</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine that your site is being viewed from a mobile phone. Your user
enters an elevator or a tunnel, and connectivity drops temporarily right
in the middle of an API call. Can you recover?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are considerations to be made in recovering gracefully. If the
user started an interaction in offline mode and suddenly regains their
connection, it&#8217;s generally not a great idea to assume that the
connection is then steadfast and reliable. In other words, do not
suddenly assume that internet is fantastic and there to stay.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a common failure of applications with amazing offline support.
As soon as they detect a connection, they attempt to flush all local
changes to their cloud services. If everything goes well, and the
connection is indeed back for good, <em>great!</em> But - as is often the case,
if the connection then goes down while these local changes are being
sent up to the API, everything that was waiting to be sent to the API in
the local cache is lost.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This happens for example in Asana (a todo list application) for iOS,
which is often recommended entirely because of the service&#8217;s advertised
offline syncing. Imagine this: You write up a bunch of todo items when
underground or without an internet connection. Your offline changes stay
on your phone, waiting for the moment you regain service, so they can
sync back up to Asana&#8217;s servers. This all works perfectly when you have
a great connection, <em>but</em> if that sync attempt gets a 500 it throws a
bunch of alert boxes and errors, then eventually just forgets about the
todo items, along with the user who wrote them. <em>Sorry I didn&#8217;t get you
a birthday present, mum!</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_some_services_or_endpoints_are_offline">7.3.3. Some services or endpoints are offline</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What happens if the API you&#8217;re trying to access is down for maintenance?
Most modern applications take advantage of <em>many</em> external services. If
an APi or service is not critical to the functionality of your
application, the show must go on! Don&#8217;t disable everything because your
connection to the Google Analytics API is down.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This can be done with frontend circuit breakers, or just generally
checking if services are down. Naturally, some judgement is needed to
decide how to handle missing services.  Completely non-critical services
should fail silently, and those which fall somewhere between there and
being mission critical should be disabled intelligently.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In some cases, that should be exactly what it sounds like - let your
users know something is missing or offline temporarily, and disable any
interface elements that might lead to that offline service breaking
things.  In other cases, after letting users know that something is
temporarily offline, it might be better to get it out of their way - and
to hide it until that service comes back online.</p>

OpenStreetMap, or another similar service. If you&#8217;re loading images on

<h4 id="_api_retries">7.3.4. API retries</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It can be easy to forget that there are times when API requests might
fail the first time they&#8217;re sent. Many front-end frameworks allow
developers to
<a href="https://github.com/greatjapa/node-fetch-retry">automatically</a>
<a href="https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/faraday/Faraday/Request/Retry">retry</a>
failed requests. This is great when connections drop momentarily, but
requires some restraint: be mindful that each retry attempt takes a
finite amount of time. If these attempts prevent users from accessing a
part of your interface, excessive retry attempts will make your app feel
unresponsive and broken. In order to combat this feeling, give your
users the ability to cancel retry attempts, and display a message or
status on your interface that clearly shows that a retry attempt is
being made.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should have an application-wide strategy for retrying failed API
calls.  If you detect that an API fails, it may be okay to retry that
call 2 or 3 times before alerting the user that something is wrong.  In
these cases, it&#8217;s also a good idea to keep track of the amount of time
between sending the initial request and alerting users - in cases where
API calls are taking multiple seconds to fail, it will be better to show
a failure notice as soon as you detect the first failure.  This takes
some intuition, and may also require some fine-tuning on a per-scenario
basis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While retrying, it&#8217;s also a good idea to add an exponential backoff to
your API calls.  In essence, this means you might wait 100ms after the
first API call fails (to give the server a chance to get its act
together), and 200ms after the second, then 400ms, etc.  At scale, this
will prevent you from accidentally DDoSing your API services when
there&#8217;s a brief failure of an API.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s also a great idea to communicate to your users when calls are
taking longer than expected, too.  Letting them know in plain english
that you&#8217;re waiting for a response from the server gives you a chance to
let users know that your app hasn&#8217;t frozen or crashed.  This is also an
opportunity to send a link to a system status page, so users can see
whether the problem they&#8217;re having is local to them or not.</p>

<h4 id="_the_tricky_inverse_limiting_debouncing_buffering_requests">7.3.5. The tricky inverse - limiting / debouncing / buffering requests</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When firing off API requests, you should take care to make sure that
your interface won&#8217;t allow users to send the <em>same</em> request again while
waiting for a response. This can be accomplished in a few different ways
- for actions that create or destroy data (like "New invoice" or "Delete
this user"), make sure to <em>disable</em> the action buttons and menu items
that can trigger that behavior, until it is complete. Complete can mean
either a success or a failure, so remember not to keep that button
disabled if something failed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For less destructive actions (like refreshing a list, for example),
using something like a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/debounce">debounce</a>
function to limit the number of API calls users are able to send is
advisable. A well-crafted API will reject rapidfire responses with a
rate limiter of some sort, explained elsewhere in the book. Your
interfaces can interpret such responses and dynamically enable/disable
bits of interface accordingly, while providing meaningful messages for
your users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may also have the luxury of using or building APIs that provide
something like <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/idempotency">Stripe&#8217;s Idempotency

<p>If you&#8217;re doing something semi-permanent, make sure you give users the

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Undo can be accomplished both proactively and reactively.  Proactive
undo scenarios are extremely common; most often, this comes in the form
of a modal dialog asking "are you sure you want to do this?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reactive undo scenarios are a bit trickier with web-based applications,
since edits and actions are often sent up to the cloud somewhere via API
call, rather than being stored locally, where it&#8217;s easy to keep track of
a list of recent actions in memory.  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re using "events" logic, which might well be how you are handling
offline syncing, then this "undo" could be a case of removing the event
from a queue.  If you add delays to your queue (for certain events that
are hugely destructive or scary like sending email) then adding a 30
second delay to the queue before the event is handled makes this undo
work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another approach is to keep track of the relevant actions a user has
taken by way of a queue structure in your database.  Think of this as a
table listing instructions for your application to take on behalf of a
user. This can be useful in several ways - work completed on
asynchronous actions can be tracked to completion, and annotated with
error messages as necessary.  You can also store the information needed
to undo that action here. Finally, this can be presented back to your
users as a historical log of their activity on your service.</p>

<h2 id="_caching">8. Caching</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Caching is a huge topic, and there&#8217;s a lot of different types of caching
which makes discussing it tricky. The most basic definition of caching
is: avoid wasting time computing the answer to the same questions over
and over again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A backend program will often cache the response to database calls to
avoid making them multiple times. It could then also cache the
serialized output to avoid needing to convert the model into JSON
multiple times, and other stuff can be cached too. In the world of APIs,
caching can do a lot more. HTTP calls can be skipped by clients, or
memorized by servers to skip the application server having to do get
involved to answer a similar request. All of this could happen in the
life-cycle of a single request.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For backend applications data stores like <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> and
<a href="https://www.memcached.org/">Memcached</a> are the most common caching
solutions, but anything can be a cache. The file system (not the most
performant) or plain-old SQL can be used to cache data. Frontend
applications running in a web browser often use
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage/LocalStorage">LocalStorage</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_caching_and_performance">8.1. Caching and Performance</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Often caching is misused by inexperienced developers to try and make
slow code look like fast code. This leads other folks to consider
caching a crutch that should be avoided whenever possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal of caching on the client side is not "to make our application
faster", but to avoid asking questions if we have an acceptable level of
confidence that we already know the answers. Making unnecessary
requests, even if they are fast, is of course going to be slower than
just not making those requests. This is what caching is about.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_caching_in_relation_to_apis">8.2. Caching in relation to APIs</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the rest of this chapter we&#8217;re going to skip talking about caching
in a general way, and talk about caching as it relates to API requests
and responses. As such there are three terms we&#8217;re going to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Application Caching:</strong> Software like Memcache, Redis, etc. can be
implemented in your application, to cache whatever you want, for however
long you want, in whatever data store you want.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Network Caching:</strong> Tools like <a href="https://www.varnish-cache.org/">Varnish</a> or
<a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/">Squid</a> (known as "cache proxies") intercept
requests that look the same, then return a response early straight out
of memory instead of hitting the application server. Doing this allows
the application server to spend more time handling other traffic, and
can reduce network latency for clients.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Client Caching:</strong> The client, browser, app, another service, etc. can
treat an API response just like any other CSS, Javascript or Image file.
If that resource had an expire time, ETags, or one of a few other cache
related headers, the last request could be directly reused, or a
conditional request might be triggered to see if the data has changed,
instead of grabbing the whole resource every time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>HTTP Caching:</strong> A set of conventions written into the HTTP
specification, which is a way to collectively refer to both network and
client caching when it relates to HTTP. GraphQL for example has it&#8217;s own
set of conventions for supplying network caching, but HTTP caching at
its core should theoretically work for any programming language,
framework, or paradigm, that respects the specification and doesn&#8217;t
build in its own contradicting conventions on top.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_application_caching">8.2.1. Application Caching</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So you&#8217;re writing a client application, and you like the idea of
skipping duplicate requests for a few reasons. Maybe you want to avoid
going over the API rate limit, draining the battery of the mobile
device, or avoid going over the wire if you don&#8217;t have to. All good
reasons to look into caching responses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At first you might consider application caching. In Rails, using
application caching to wrap an API request usually looks a bit like
this:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Rails.cache.fetch("users/#{uuid}") do
  UserAPI.find_user(uuid)
end</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If there is nothing in the cache with the key <code>user/foo</code> then it will
run the code contained in the "`do"` block, which calls a method on the
SDK and goes over the wire to fetch the thing. That is handy and all,
but how long does that cache entry last? The answer is forever! Infinity
is a long time, so we have to provide a reasonable expire period.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Rails.cache.fetch("users/#{uuid}", expires_in: 12.hours.from_now) do
  UserAPI.find_user(uuid)
end</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That is great and all, but the you - the client - providing "12" is
possibly not something you should be doing, as you do not own the data.
If this is an RPC API and you are part of the same team as the folks who
made it, you might know enough about the data source to be confident in
making this call, but if you do not own the data then picking an
arbitrary number is a bad idea.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even if 12 is an appropriate number at the time, cache duration could
change for a number of reasons. In the most simple case, this leads to
"My email address is showing up differently in multiple places", but
beyond that there may be all sorts of business logic potentially
involved with how long data should be cached.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve experienced odd situations where a race condition was causing a
resource to fetched immediately after it was created, which would cause
it to be cached for 5 hours. An important update would happen a few
minutes after creation letting us know what sort of membership the user
had. That update was not noticed by the system doing this hard
time-based caching for that whole 5 hours. Some folks would set up
complex invalidation rules, or say "well that data cannot be cached!"
but in reality the data could easily be cached after that initial state.
We switched from time-based application caching, to using HTTP caching.
This allowed the API to define how long the data should be cached for,
and the client just does what it&#8217;s told.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>expiry_time = model.present? ? 15.minutes : 5.hours
expires_in(expiry_time, public: true)
render_json_response :ok, user_memberships if stale?(model)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Having the flexibility to let the API tell clients how long to cache
things for is really handy, but sounds a lot like magic. Let&#8217;s take a
look at HTTP caching to see how it all works.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_http_caching">8.2.2. HTTP Caching</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>HTTP caching is one of the best parts of the HTTP specification. At it
most simple it&#8217;s just telling various actors (like an API client) how
long to keep data before they chuck it out, and at its most complex it
solves the issue of cache invalidation - one of the toughest problems in
programming.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any "endpoint-based" API can use HTTP caching, so potentially you could
run into it quite often, but it&#8217;s also ignored by a lot of API
developers who just do not know it exists.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Basically there are a whole bunch of conventions outlines in
<a href="http://Speeding">RFC 7234: HTTP/1.1 Caching</a>, the most commonly used of
which is the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control">Cache-Control
HTTP header</a>, which resources can use to define its cacheability. The
idea of defining cacheability is one of the main requirements for a REST
API, and it refers to a standard way to "control" who can cache the
response, what they can do with it, under which conditions, and for how
long. If a GET request has a <code>Cache-Control</code> header, the client knows it
can keep it around for a while.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Cache-Control: max-age=120</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here the API is telling clients they should keep that information for
two minutes, but it can do a whole lot more than that. There is
conditional validation, which allow for requests asking "only respond
with data if it has changed since my last request", and you can create
all sorts of complex instructions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main idea is to avoid repeating the same GET requests, because no
matter how well optimized the API is at responding, not making a request
is quicker than making a request. Storing a local copy of a response
allows you to skip network latency entirely, which not only saves the
end user from waiting, but can also save money too. Respecting cache
control headers provided by an API will make your end users experience
feel quicker, cheaper, reduce power usage (important for mobile
devices). If the API is leveraging network caching too, then when your
client does make requests, there is a chance the responses will be
served from the cache server, which is usually quicker than the
application server. It is also often sitting "at the edge" if it&#8217;s a CDN
("Content Delivery Network") style network cache.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a lot to learn about HTTP caching, and some of the words used
do not mean what you would expect them to mean anything first glance.
Google have
<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/http-caching">an
amazing guide</a> which is designed at understanding the concepts in
general, and the hosting company <a href="https://www.fortrabbit.com/">Fortrabbit</a>
have written a brilliant
<a href="https://blog.fortrabbit.com///blog.fortrabbit.com/mastering-http-caching">article
on HTTP caching for applications in general</a>. To leverage some of their
writing, here is an overview of the Cache-Control header from
fortrabbit:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Cache-Control header controls not just the request and response, but
holds instructions for potentially two cache locations: The "local
cache" (aka "private cache") and the "shared cache".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The local cache, is a cache on the local disk of the machine running the
browser. Your laptop, if you will. Be aware that you don&#8217;t have "exact
control" over that cache. Ultimately, the browser decides whether to
follow your "suggestions" or not, which means: don&#8217;t rely on it. The
user might clear all caches whenever the browser is closed and you would
not know about it, aside from increased traffic cause those caches
invalidate faster then you anticipate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The shared cache &#8230;&#8203; between the web server and the client. The CDN, in
this case. You have full control over the shared cache and should
leverage it to the fullest.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OK, let&#8217;s dive in with some code examples. I&#8217;ll explain in detail below:</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Cache-Control: public max-age=3600
Cache-Control: private immutable
Cache-Control: no-cache
Cache-Control: public max-age=3600 s-maxage=7200
Cache-Control: public max-age=3600 proxy-revalidate</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That might look a bit confusing, but don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s not that hard.
First you should now that Cache-Control takes three "kinds" of
directives: Cachability, expiration and revalidation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First cachability, which takes care of the cache location, which in
includes whether it should be cached at all. The most important
directives are:</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>private:</strong> Means it shall only be cached in the local (private) cache.
On your laptop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>public:</strong> Means it shall be cached in the shared cache. In the CDN. It
can also be cached on the local cache, though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>no-cache:</strong> Interestingly this means caching is allowed - just
everybody (local cache, shared cache) must revalidate before using the
cached value</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>no-store:</strong> Means it shall not be cached. Nowhere. Not ever.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next up is expiration, which takes care of how long things are cached.
The most important directives are: * <strong>max-age=&lt;seconds&gt;:</strong> Sets the cache
validity time. How many seconds shall the cache location keep it? Goes
for local and shared cache. * <strong>s-maxage=&lt;seconds&gt;:</strong> Overrides max-age
just for the shared cache. No effect on local cache.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lastly there is revalidation, which is, more or less, fine control. The
most important directives are: * <strong>immutable:</strong> Means that the document
won&#8217;t change. Ever. Can be cached until the heat death of the universe.
* <strong>must-revalidate:</strong> Means the client (browser) must still check with
the proxy (CDN), even while it&#8217;s cached! * <strong>proxy-revalidate:</strong> Means
that the shared cache (CDN) must check the origin, even while it&#8217;s
cached!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And to put it all together, here is how to read the above code examples
in plain English: 1. Cache it both on CDN and laptop for an hour. 2.
Don&#8217;t store in CDN, only on laptop. Once cached (on laptop), no need to
ever refresh it. 3. Don&#8217;t cache it - or do. Just make sure to revalidate
always! 4. Cache it for an hour on laptop, but for two hours on the CDN
5. Cache it both on CDN and laptop for an hour. BUT: if a request hits
the CDN, although it&#8217;s cached here for an hour, it still must check with
the origin whether the document is still unchanged.</p>

<p>Couldn&#8217;t have put that any better myself! We&#8217;ve spoken a bit here about

concepts in more detail.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_client_caching">8.2.3. Client Caching</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Client caching when leveraging the HTTP standard is no different from
how caching works for Javascript, images, etc. There are some headers
telling the client how long to keep this data around, and after that you
can chuck it out entirely, or check to see if it is still valid.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is how browsers interact with websites: the browser assumes the
website is the one in charge of certain things like how long to cache
data. Whenever you go to pretty much any website, the server defines
various cache-related headers and the browser respects them (unless told
to override them via something like a hard refresh).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we build systems that call other systems, we often skip out this
step, and performance can suffer. Hopefully the API you are integrating
with has <code>Cache-Control</code> headers, if not, you are on your own and have
to use the application caching approach we discussed before.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_implementing_http_clientcaching">8.3. Implementing HTTP Client Caching</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At work we built an upstream "Permissions" API, which would talk to a
lot of other systems to see if a user should be allowed to complete the
action they were attempting to make. One request from the end-user could
end up making 5 more HTTP requests to other services which were not
always the quickest.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We threw a few <code>Cache-Control</code> headers on the different services the
Permissions API was calling, like on user profiles, membership
information, etc., then enabled HTTP client caching using a middleware
for our Ruby HTTP client:
<a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/faraday-http-cache">faraday-http-cache</a>.
This thing took an instance of a Redis client, and no more work was
required.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This benchmark is of course somewhat artificial due to requesting the
same handfuls of users and their related membership data thousands of
times, but repeat requests are down to ~250ms from 3.5s. This is
substantial however you spin it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>We also later switched from making these calls synchronously, to
asynchronously, which of course saved a buuuuunch of time.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This was done with standard <code>max-age</code> based caching, which is often
incredibly useful all by itself. These days a lot of people act like
their APIs are "big data" and everything must be completely real-time,
but in most cases having data be a few minutes out-of-date is fine.
Basic profile data for a company could absolutely take a few minutes to
update, as they&#8217;re probably not changing their Opening Hours or name
very often. Featured items on an e-commerce store is also not likely to
change on the regular. I used to work for a financial company which
build stocks and shares monitoring systems, and they&#8217;d cache most</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An API developer could set an hour long max-age for these things, then
clients would only need to make the call to the API once an hour.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For information that is more subject to change, a max-age might still be
appropriate, it would just be much shorter. This has a few benefits,
like making sure browser-based application users can hit the Back button
without replicating every single request again, or improving the speed
of a backend-based data import script which has a HTTP request written
into a loop. Respecting a 10 second cache is still going to cut down
load on the server, and speed things up for the client in many cases.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_conditional_validation">8.4. Conditional Validation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Caching based entirely on time is not always the most helpful, but that
does not mean client caching should be thrown out. Basic time-based
caching will help a client skip making requests entirely, but
conditional requests can be made which are much quicker than standard
requests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A conditional request is one which attaches a HTTP header with some sort
of information that basically asks the server: has data changed since
this previous request? If the data is the same, you can skip downloading
it all Armani, which reduces load on the server, reduces data going over
the wire, saves battery use on mobiles, and reduces data transfer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using HTTP caching there are two headers that enable this functionality:
If-Modified-Since, and If-Match-None. The first accepts a timestamp, and
basically the client is letting the server know then time it last got a
response, so it only cares about new data. The second is a bit more
involved. Maybe you&#8217;ve heard of the concept of Etags, but are not really
sure what they are?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Etags are usually some unique hash, which in web frameworks like Rails
are a md5 checksum of the type of model, a unique ID, and an updated at
timestamp.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>etag = md5(author/123/2018-12-01)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This etag is then returned in a response to a GET request, which the
client can save, and reuse on a subsequent request. In the request it
goes into the If-Match-None header, and if the API is paying attention
if it will rerun the checksum. If the checksum matches it will return a
304 Not Modified with no body, and if there is a mismatch it will shove
the normal JSON response into the HTTP body</p>

<p><strong>Real World Considerations</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not every HTTP GET request is one you want to cache. The middleware will
generally do the correct thing so long as the server has declared their
intentions well, but regardless of how well the server declares its
cacheability, you may way to store things for longer, shorter, or not at
all.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Maybe Stale is Better Than Nothing</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Disrespecting the max age of a response can have similar effects to
ignoring the use-by date on a carton of milk, but if you&#8217;re aware of
what you&#8217;re doing then sometimes ignoring the intentions of the server
to persist longer makes sense.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Admin Panels</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There will be times when you want to make sure things are as fresh as
possible, and don&#8217;t mind waiting a little longer to get it. If you are
calling the same API for both typical frontend functionality for a
user-facing web/mobile app, and also using it to populate data for an
"admin panel", then you might want to skip cached responses for the
admin panel. Sure you can use cached results on many of the admin panel
"list" or "overview" pages, but when it gets to the "edit form" you
would be better off waiting a little longer to get the latest
information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Hard Refresh in your App</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Writing your own application caching logic for requests to other site
can lead to unexpected caching in front end applications. End users of
web applications expect the refresh button to work, and if you have
cached data in a way that won&#8217;t work with the refresh button 5t can
cause trouble. End users of mobile devices generally expect to "pull
down to refresh" on feeds or similar interfaces, which can be
problematic if its not there. Following the rules of HTTP caching makes
it pretty easy to implement this functionality locally in your front end
application. Again, you can simply throw a Cache-Control: no-cache on
there.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_sometimes_http_caching_is_inefficient">8.4.7. Sometimes HTTP Caching is Inefficient</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are making multiple calls to APIs with large responses to create
one composite resource (one local thing made out of multiple remote
things) you might not want to cache the calls.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the client is only using a few fields from each response, caching all
of the responses is going to swamp the cache server. File-based cache
stores might be slower than making the HTTP call, and Redis or Memcache
caches may well run out of space.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Besides, restitching the data from those multiple requests to make the
composite resource locally may be too costly on the CPU. In that case
absolutely stick to application-level caching the composite resource
instead of using the low level HTTP cache. You can use your own rules
and logic on expiry, etc. because the composite item is yours.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One final example: if you have data that changes based on the
authenticated user, you&#8217;ll need to use <code>Vary: Authentication</code>, which
basically segments the caches by <code>Authentication</code> header. Two requests
that are identical in all ways other than the <code>Authentication</code> header
will result in two different cache results.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This can lower cache hit ratios so much it might not be worth worrying
about. Depends. Give it a try.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>GRPC</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Seeing as gRPC is not an "endpoint-based" API implementation, there is
no way for HTTP caching to work. That said, if they have implemented the
"REST Bridge" then they might have applied Cache-Control headers, so
maybe you can hook onto that. The REST Bridge really just means RESTish
(they have endpoints instead of firing methods and arguments at it), so
same rules apply.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to cache gRPC data and they do not have the REST bridge,
then you need to roll your own application caching. Pick an arbitrary
number that seems appropriate, and cache away.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>GraphQL</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The recommendation from the GraphQL documentation suggests the
responsibility of caching falls on clients to implement their own
application caching:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In an endpoint-based API, clients can use HTTP caching to easily avoid
refetching resources, and for identifying when two resources are the
same. The URL in these APIs is a globally unique identifier that the
client can leverage to build a cache. In GraphQL, though, there&#8217;s no
URL-like primitive that provides this globally unique identifier for a
given object. It&#8217;s hence a best practice for the API to expose such an
identifier for clients to use. --- <strong>Source:</strong>
<a href="http://graphql.org/learn/caching/"><strong>graphql.org</strong></a></p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is advertised like a feature, but as we discussed already having a
client decide arbitrary cache lifetimes is often rather questionable.
Due to the way GraphQL is implemented on a single endpoint (and usually
as a POST(, trying to use any existing client caching middleware would
not work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are some third-party extensions showing up that place extra
metadata into the response, and that metadata looks a lot like some of
the keywords found in the HTTP caching standard. If you spot these
keywords on an API you are working with, check the API documentation to
see if there is mention of which of these various extensions it is, so
you know how to work with it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_network_caching">8.4.8. Network Caching</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The same conventions that govern HTTP client caching caching also govern
HTTP network caching; in that the majority of it is operated through the
same HTTP headers like Cache-Control and Etag.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Network caching is a really powerful but often overlooked component in a
robust API-centric architecture. Whilst client caching focuses on local
caches on each device that is making calls, network caching focuses on
sharing responses to requests that pass through the network, which could
be potentially made by different clients.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This has the benefit of taking traffic off of application servers,
meaning some traffic spikes can be smoothed out whe n clients are
request similar data. It also provides similar benefits to caching
CSS/JS/images on "the edge".</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/Attachment.png" alt="image">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>CDNs cache assets on servers physically spread around the world, meaning
the assets spend less time traveling over the wire, and that means
quicker downloads times for the end users requesting them. API responses
can be cached in exactly the same way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Network caching and client caching can be used together in combination,
following the same set of rules, which helps to avoid complex
invalidation logic. Thanks to client caching you can skip making request
sometimes, then other times you grab data from somewhere physically
closer to you than the application server may be. On top of the geo
benefit that network cache response is coming straight from memory,
instead of waiting for some poorly optimised API written in a dynamic
language hastily put together by developers focusing on business goals
and maybe not writing the very most performant code possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The basic idea looks a little like this:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Varnish and Squid are two common tools, and Fastly is a hosted version
of Varnish. Hopefully the API developers will mention they use a network
cache in their documentation somewhere, but if they do not there are
common signs to look out for. Most systems will add some headers, like
X-Cache, X-Cache-Hit, and there is also X-Served-By which in the case of
Fastly will let you know the names of some cache nodes that served it
up.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The HTTP-based cache tools can leverage HTTP headers like Etag, Vary,
Cache-Control to handle cache validation, and know all the rules of
HTTP, meaning this application caching can essentially be thrown in and
function with very little effort from the API developers. Clients will
get a speed boost without even having to implement their own client
caching, even though they still could, and still should, as requesting
data over the wire from the cache server is still slower than not
requesting data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An interesting thing about these HTTP conventions is that they were
designed to work in a lot of situations that you probably never
considered. I was blown away to hear of a use case, where HTTP cache
proxies were installed in towns around Africa, to provide cached
responses for websites that either didn&#8217;t already network cache their
responses, or did but didn&#8217;t have any cache servers anywhere near that
town. It meant that everyone saves a bunch of money on their data plans
and the internet still works as expected.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The same logic that applies to websites also applies to data. If you are
talking to a third-party API which has cache control headers but they
didn&#8217;t bother setting up network caching, you can set that up for them
with these tools.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Max-Age Network Caching</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The easiest type of network caching to understand is max age based
stuff. If the API shoved a max-age=60 in there, the cache server will
simply return that value if the request is within 60 seconds of a
previous matching request. Theoretically the data cloud have changed,
but the API is declaring that using 60 second old data is good enough.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A common misconception abut network caches is that they&#8217;ll always
returned cached data and clients have no say in the matter. In the
client caching section we talked about choosing when to skip the local
cache --- for things like hard refresh, or for whatever other reason the
freshest data is required - and its exactly the same with network
caching. The Cache-Control header can be used to bypass the cached
version, and hit the application server to fetch the freshest data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Something I find to be very cool, and exceptionally handy, is that API
developers can set specific instructions for a network cache on top of
the usual rules. If a API developer sets Cache-Control: max-age=30 then
sure, clients and the network will both keep that thing around for 30
seconds, but if they set Cache-Control: max-age=30,s-maxage=86400 then
its going to keep that thing around on the cache server for a whole day,
but the client cache will only last for 30 seconds. This allows the
developers to set up their own edge cache purging process, updating the
cache server proactively if things change, and it still keeps the client
applicatiton performant by skipping repeat requests in a 30 second
window. Then when the thing is past thirty seconds its off to the
network cache, which is hopefully physically closer!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Conditional Validation In Network Caching</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ok so time based network caching might make enough sense, but what about
conditional validation with things like Etag?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you make a conditional request to a cache server, you are always
going to hit the application server. This confused me so much when I
first started digging into this. What on earth is the point of that?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assuming there was a max age on there, the response was considered
"fresh" for some time, then the client cache had to validate to see if
anything has changed. The conditional check will pass straight through
the network cache, and the same conditional check is made to the
application server. If the etag does not match, then it is considered
"stale", and the full response will be returned by the API: a 200 OK
with a whole bunch of JSON to give the network cache, and the client
cache, a full new response to hold onto. If things changed, the 304 Not
Modified is returned by the application and passed through the network
cache to let the client cache know its got the latest thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Network caching is not wildly useful for conditional validation, it is
mainly there for max age based stuff, but if the API developers are
leveraging both then it still has value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>GraphQL</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to the way GraphQL generally operates POSTing against a single
endpoint, HTTP is demoted to the role of a dumb tunnel, making network
caching tools like Varnish, Squid, Fastly, etc. almost entirely useless.
If the API developers were kind enough to also allow queries to be made
over GET then you can switch to using that, and technically network
caching will work at a very basic level, but the chance of a cache hit
is minimal, as the entire query has to match perfectly (asking for foo
and bar, not bar and foo). It&#8217;s not even guaranteed that GET is
supported for a given API.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With standard HTTP-based network caching essentially removed from the
equation, some third-party solutions have started popping up. One of
these is FastQL, a name inspired by Fast.ly but built specifically for
GraphQL. It might not be easily to tell if the API developers have that
enabled.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If they have not enabled a network cache you are out of option. Unlik
HTTP-based caching solutions, client developers are not be able to run
their own network cache that the API development team is unaware of, as
it relies on purge requests being made to it to remove outdated
information and replace it with newer information. Basically that means
if you set up your own network cache, you would have to find some way to
subscribe to data changes on their end, and repopulate the data on the
cache server maybe using some sort of scheduled job, all of which sounds
like quite the faff.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_validation">9. Validation</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whenever an API client attempts an operation (creating a REST resource,
triggering an RPC procedure, etc.) there are usually some validation
rules to consider. For example, the <code>name</code> field is required and and
cannot be longer than 20 characters long, <code>email</code> must be a valid email
address, the <code>date</code> field should be a valid ISO 8601 date, and either
the home phone <em>or</em> mobile phone field must be entered to send a text
message, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two locations in which these rules can live, the server and
the client.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Client-side validation is incredibly important, as it provides immediate
visual feedback to the user. Depending on the UI/UX of the client
application, this might come in the form of making invalid boxes red,
scrolling the user to the problem, showing basic alert boxes, or
disabling the submit button until the local data looks good.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/validation-ui-boxes.png" alt="image">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To create this functionality, a common approach is to reproduce
server-side validation in the client-side. This should be avoided at all
costs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is awfully common for client developers to read the API
documentation, take note of prominent validation rules, then write a
bunch of code to handle those rules on their own end. If their code
considers the data valid, it will pass it all onto the server on some
event (probably on submit) and hopefully the server will agree.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This seems to make sense at first, as frontend applications want
immediate feedback on input without having to ask the server about
validity. Unfortunately this approach does not scale particularly well,
and cannot handle even the smallest evolution of functionality. Rules
can be added, removed or changed for the API as the business
requirements change, and clients struggle to keep up to date. Arguably
the API development team should not be randomly changing things, but
change always happens in some form. The varying versioning strategies
for APIs will be discussed later, but even extremely cautious API
developers can introduce unexpectedly breaking change when it comes to
validation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most simple example would be the above mentioned name field, with a
max length of 20 characters. Months later, requirements come in from the
business to increase the max length to 40, and the API rolls out that
change. The API developers have a chat, and decide that making
validation rules more lenient cannot be considered breaking, as all
previous requests will still function. So they deploy the change with a
max length of 40 characters, and one client-app deploys an update to
match, increasing the validation to 40. Despite various client
applications still having the hardcoded max length at 20 characters,
everyone feels pretty happy about this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One user jumps on this chance for a long name, going well over the 20
character limit. Later on the iOS application, they try to edit another
field on the same form, but notice their name has been truncated to 20
characters as the input field will not take any more than that.
Confused, they grab their friends phone and try it out there. The
Android application does something a little different: the full 40
characters are populated into the form, but client-side validation is
showing an error when the form is submitted. The user profile cannot be
updated at all on this application without the user truncating their
name&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is certainly not the only potential issue. The API creating a new
allowed value to an "enum" field will cause the same sort of problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the API you are attempting to integrate with, you may be
doomed to suffer this sort of fate, but there are ways to mitigate this
problem. Depending on the type of API, you can probably find a way to
synchronize validation between client and server.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_client_validation_via_contracts">9.1. Client-Validation via Contracts</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Well built APIs generally offer a copy of their contracts in a
programmatically accessible format. The idea is that validation rules
should be written down somewhere, and not just inside the backend
server. If the validation rules can be seen by API clients, clients are
going to be far more robust, and not break on tiny validation changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These contracts can be called many things. Some refer to them as "data
models" or "schemas", and there are many different implementations with
different pros and cons. Here are some of the good ones.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>These contracts provide a wide array of functionality to API developers.
Some API developers generate human-readable documentation from them,
some even generate SDKs from them. Some will use them for validating
incoming payloads to save writing up the same validation rules
themselves. Client-side validation is yet another feature some of these
systems are able to provide, saving a trip over the wire, and hopefully
avoiding validation hell.</p>

<p>There is quite a lot of stuff here, but most of it should make sense to
the human eye without too much guesswork. We are listing "properties" by
name, giving them a data type, setting up maxLength for the name
according to the example earlier, and putting human-readable
descriptions in there too. Also some examples have been thrown in for
giggles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The one bit that probably needs more explaining is the $schema key,
which is pointing to the draft version of JSON Schema in use. Knowing
which draft you are validating against is important, as a JSON Schema
file written for Draft 07 cannot be validated with a Draft 06 validator,
or lower. Luckily most JSON Schema tools keep up fairly well, and JSON
Schema is not madly changing crap at random.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to it: An example of a valid instance for that .json schema
file might look like this.</p>

<p>Conceptually that probably makes enough sense, but how to actually
programmatically get this done? The JSON Schema .json files are usually
made available somewhere in a HTTP Link header
<a href="http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-core.html">with a rel of
describedby</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Link: &lt;http://example.com/schemas/user.json#&gt;; rel="describedby"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This might look a bit off to those not used to Link headers, but this is
how a lot of links are handled these days. The one difficulty here is
parsing the value, which can be done with some extremely awful regex, or
with a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988">RFC5988</a> compliant link
parser - like
<a href="https://github.com/thlorenz/parse-link-headerhttps://github.com/thlorenz/parse-link-header">parse-link-header</a>
for JavaScript.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another approach that some APIs use (like the
<a href="https://docs.api.getpostman.com/">Postman Pro API</a>) is to shove a URL in
the HTTP body instead. A GET request on <code>/collections/{id}</code> will return
all the JSON, and a schema field somewhere in the payload.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>{
    "collection": {
        "info": {
            "name": "[Turtles.com](http://Turtles.com)",

            "schema": "https://schema.getpostman.com/json/collection/v2.0.0/collection.json"
        },</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Either way, once a API client has the schema URL they can download the
file. This involves simply making a GET request to the URL provided.
Fear not about performance, these are usually stored on CDNs, like S3
with CloudFlare in front of it. They are also very likely to have cache
headers set, so a HTTP client with caching middleware will keep that
locally, or you can manually cache it by inspecting the cache headers.
More on that later.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Triggering validation rules on a random website is one thing, but
learning how to do that with code is going to be far more useful. For
JavaScript a module called <a href="https://github.com/korzio/ajv">ajv</a> is fairly
popular, so install that with a simple <code>yarn add ajv@6</code>, then shove it
in a JavaScript file. This code is available on the GitHub Repository

<p>For the sake of keeping the example short, the actual JSON Schema has

a local file. This is not quite how you would normally do things, and it
will become clear why in a moment.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <code>validation()</code> function is created to wrap the validation logic in a
simple helper, then we move on to pretending we have some input. The
input would realistically probably be pulled from a form or another
dynamic source, so use your imagination there. Finally onto the meat,
calling the validation, and triggering errors.</p>

<p>At first this may seem like a pile of unusable gibberish, but it is
actually incredibly useful. How? The dataPath by default uses JavaScript
property access notation, so you can easily write a bit of code that
figures out the input.email was the problem. That said, JSON Pointers
might be a better idea. A much larger example, again available on
Github, will show how JSON Pointers can be used to create dynamic
errors.</p>

<p>The important things to note in this example are the <code>new Ajv(\{

<a href="mailto:https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-pointer">json-pointer</a> npm
package), and find the relevant property object. From there we now have
access to the human readable title, and we can build out some human
readable errors based off of the various properties returned. This code
might be a little odd looking, but we support a few types of error quite
nicely. Consider the following inputs.</p>

<h3 id="_what_about_validation_hell">9.3. What about Validation Hell?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Earlier validation hell was mentioned, and JSON Schema is supposed to
avoid it. But how? The API client now has this JSON Schema file locally,
and if the server changes&#8230;&#8203; how does it know? This sample code storing
the schema in the repo along with the source code, which - generally
speaking - is a pretty bad idea, only done for simplicity of the
example.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Put very simply, if the API developers change the schema file to have a
maxLength of 40, any client should then get that change the next time
they request the schema file. That is a fluffy simplicity which has a
few details to explain&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This URL is not versioned, which suggests that it might change. This
is&#8230;&#8203; possibly ok, as long as they have not set a long cache. If a
client application is respecting cache headers, and the schema file has
cache headers, then your application could suffer from validation hell
for the duration of the cache. If the cache is only set to something
short like 5 minutes, and the change is only a minor one, honestly might
not be too bad. The whole "multiple devices being used to try to make
profile changes and getting clobbered by a maxLength change" scenario we
have been discussing actually would not really be an issue if the cache
was reasonably short, but if it was set to days or longer you could be
in trouble. The <a href="#client-caching">Caching chapter</a> will help make
more sense of this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some APIs version their schema files, and as such new versions <em>should</em>
be published as a new URL.</p>

<p>So long as URLs are not hardcoded in your application, and the URL is
being read from the response (taken from wherever the API provides the

cause your application to fetch the new schema, allowing your
application to notice the new validation essentially immediately.</p>

<h3 id="_protobuff">9.4. Protobuff</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are interacting with an API using Protobuf, setting up a payload
is as easy as writing code. Protobuf has types defined in <code>.proto</code>
files, which you will need access to. The example Google use is an
<code>addressbook.proto</code> , which looks a bit like this.</p>

<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">

    HOME = 1;
    WORK = 2;

  message PhoneNumber {
    required string number = 1;
    optional PhoneType type = 2 [default = HOME];
  }

  repeated PhoneNumber phones = 4;
}

message AddressBook {
  repeated Person people = 1;
}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A fairly complex example to get started with (classic Google), but the
idea here is quite simple. By providing a bunch of information about
what fields are expected, which are optional/required, what possible
values are permitted for <code>PhoneType</code>, etc., it is possible to validate
data locally and ensure the server is not going to freak out when
information is sent up to it.</p>

phone.type = addressbook_pb2.Person.HOME</pre>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that these assignments are not just adding arbitrary new fields to
a generic Python object. If you were to try to assign a field that isn&#8217;t
defined in the .proto file, an AttributeError would be raised. If you
assign a field to a value of the wrong type, a TypeError will be raised.
Also, reading the value of a field before it has been set returns the
default value.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whenever possible it is best to make calls to other APIs asynchronously.
Doing something in the background and letting the user know it is done
usually beats making the user wait for the slow thing to happen in real
time. This might mean they see a blank page, or have no idea of progress
for seconds, minutes, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes things cannot be done asynchronously. This could be making a
request to an authentication system, to find out if the username and
password, token, etc. are valid. It could also be an API following a
design pattern known as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broker_pattern">Broker Pattern</a>. This
pattern is useful when you&#8217;re trying to build a new interface to
disguise complexity in the background, maybe temporarily while you help
two systems converge.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have seen the proper pattern used at work after acquiring another
company, we made a new "membership system" and that API would talk to
the two different user/membership systems behind the scenes, converting
those systems payloads into one unified interface for consumers. It was
not the most performant, but it let clients move over to the new system
while we worked on unifying the systems in the background. Eventually
when we were able to completely merge the systems (getting both sources
of data into the new membership system), we kept the response contracts
exactly the same, making it no longer a broker (and therefore a bunch
quicker!)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In an ideal world each service knows enough information to satisfy its
clients requests, but often there are unfortunate requirements (like the
one above) for data to be fetched, or actions to be confirmed, on the
fly. All of these things take time, and many developers make a mistake
in assuming that it will always be quick.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Frontend applications (desktop, web, iOS, Android, etc.) talk to
services, and services talk to other services. This chain of calls can
stack up, as service A calls service B, unaware that system is calling
service C and D&#8230;&#8203; So long as A, B, C and D are functioning normally,
the frontend application can hope to get a response from service A
within a "reasonable time", but if B, C or D are having a bad time, it
can cause a domino effect that takes out a large chunk of your
architecture, and the ripple effects result in a slow experience for the
end users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Slow applications can cost you a lot of money. A
<a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/?wide=1">Kissmetrics survey</a>
suggests that for every additional second a page takes to load, 7% fewer
conversions will occur, so its important to keep as much of the user
experience functioning as well as possible, for as long as possible,
even when upstream dependencies are having a rough time.</p>

all servers know to give up. Even fewer client applications know when to
give up waiting for the server, and those that do will take a while to
do it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, if service B is on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, we can
be confident the request is not going to last for more than 30 seconds.
Heroku&#8217;s router has a policy: applications get 30 seconds to send the
first byte, and if that doesn&#8217;t happen then the request gets dropped. </p>

<p>This controller has an average response time of 2.9s, but the slow ones
are floating right around that 30s mark. The Heroku Chop saves the
caller from being stuck there indefinitely, but this behavior is not
widespread. Other web servers with different policies could hang for
longer, or forever.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For this reason, never presume any service is going to respond as fast
as it usually does.  Even if that team&#8217;s developers are super confident.

<p>An <strong>open timeout</strong> asks: how long do you want to wait around to see if
this server is actually accepting requests. That can mean many things
but often means a server is too busy to take a request (there are no
available workers processing the traffic). It also depends in part on
expected network latency. If you are making an HTTP call to another
service in the same data center, the latency is going to be a few
milliseconds, but going to another continent takes time. </p>

a background worker in a backend application, that&#8217;s a worker blocked

workers configured, the same threads might be shared for multiple jobs.
If Job X is stuck for 30s waiting for this server that&#8217;s failing, Job Y

been handling other requests! For example, you are building a backend
application with an endpoint <code>GET /external</code> which is making an HTTP
calls some API. This call is usually blazing fast and has been forever,
until suddenly squirrels chew threw some impotent cables, and that API
is down a data centre.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your application is still working for now, and as usual other endpoint
are still responding in 100ms. They will continue to respond so long as
there are threads available in the various workers&#8230;&#8203; but if the
performance issues for the squirrel chewed API continue, every time a
user hits <code>GET /something</code>, another thread becomes unavailable for that
30s. </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s do a bit of math. For each thread that gets stuck, given that
thread is stuck for 30s, and most requests go through in 100ms, <strong>that&#8217;s
3000 potential requests not being handled</strong>. 3000 requests not being
handled because of a single endpoint. There will continue to be fewer
and fewer available workers, and given enough traffic to that payment
endpoint, there might be zero available workers left to work on any the
traffic to any other endpoints. Setting that timeout to 10s would result
in the processing of 2000 more successful requests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a general advice for backend developers it&#8217;s always better to avoid
making requests from the web thread. Use background jobs whenever
possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Making timeouts happen early is much more important than getting a fast
failure. The most important benefit of failing fast is to give other
resources the chance to work, and it gives users update into what&#8217;s
going on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Frontend developer might not have to worry about freeing up server
resources, but they do have to worry about the UI freezing, or other
requests being blocked due to browsers HTTP/1.1 connection limits! The
concept is very similar for both frontend and backend, don&#8217;t waste
resources waiting for responses which probably aren&#8217;t going to come.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_picking_timeouts">10.2.2. Picking Timeouts</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the server is a third party company, you might have a service-level
agreement stating: "Our API will always respond in 150ms". Great, set it
to 150ms (and retry on failure if the thing is important.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the service is in-house, then try to get access to NewRelic, CA APM
or whatever monitoring tool is being used. Looking at the response
times, you can get an idea of what should be acceptable. Be careful
though, <strong>do not look only at the average</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/5-new-relic-web-transactions-time-damn-lies.png" alt="image">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Looking at this graph may lead you to think 300ms is an appropriate
timeout. Seems fair right? The biggest spike there is 250ms and so round
it up a bit and let&#8217;s go for 300ms? </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nope! These are averages, and averages are going to be far far lower
than the slowest transactions. Click the drop-down and find "Web
transaction percentiles."</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/6-new-relic-web-transactions-percentile-more-accurate.png" alt="image">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That is a more honest representation. Most of the responses are 30-50ms,
and the average is usually sub 100ms. That said, under <strong>high load</strong> this
service starts to stutter, and these peaks can lead to responses coming
in around 850ms! Clicking around to show the slowest traces will show a
handful of requests over the last few weeks coming in at 2s, 3.4s, and
another at 5s!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Those are ridiculous, and looking at the error rate we can see that
those requests didn&#8217;t even succeed. Whatever happens, setting the
timeout low enough to cut those off is something we want to do, so far
I&#8217;m thinking about 1s. If the transactions are failing anyway, there is
no point waiting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next: if the call is being made from a background worker, that 99
percentile of 850ms may well be acceptable. Background workers are
usually in less of a rush, so go with 1s and off you go. Keep an eye on
things and trim that down if your jobs continue to back up, but that&#8217;s
probably good enough.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_retrying_slow_requests">10.2.3. Retrying Slow Requests</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If it&#8217;s a web process&#8230;&#8203; well, 2s+ is certainly no good, especially
seeing as it might fail anyway. Waiting around for this unstable
transaction to complete is as much of a good plan as skydiving with just
the one chute. Let&#8217;s create a backup plan using retries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So we have this special web application that absolutely has to have this
web request to Service B in the thread. We know this endpoint generally
responds in 35-100ms and on a bad day it can take anywhere from 300-850.
We do not want to wait around for anything over 1s as its unlikely to
even respond, but we don&#8217;t want this endpoint to take more than 1s&#8230;&#8203; </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s a plan: set the timeout to 400ms, add a retry after 50ms, then if
the first attempt is taking a while <em>boom</em>, it&#8217;ll give up and try again!</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>conn = Faraday.new('http://example.com');
conn.post('/payment_attempts', {  }) do |req|
  conn.options.timeout = 0.4
  conn.request :retry, max: 1, interval: 0.05
end</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is potential for trouble here, as the second and first attempts
might end up in a race condition. The interval there will hopefully give
the database long enough to notice the first response was successful,
meaning the 2nd request will fail and say "already paid" or something
intelligent, which can be inspected and potentially treated as a success
by the client.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyway, (400 * 2) + 50 = 950, with another 50ms for whatever other
random gumf is happening in the application, should mean that we come in
at under 1 second!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a good place to be in. You have 2x the chance of success, and
you&#8217;re setting tight controls to avoid service B messing your own
application up. </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>An important note for Ruby users</strong>: you are
<a href="https://engineering.wework.com/ruby-users-be-wary-of-net-http-f284747288b2">already
using retries</a> on idempotent requests, and you probably had no idea.
It&#8217;s wild that NetHTTP does this by default, even in Ruby v2.5.0 where
it is configurable.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_circuit_breakers">10.2.4. Circuit Breakers</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Timeouts are a great way to avoid unexpected hangs from slowing a
service down too much, and retries are a great solution to having
another when that unexpected problem happens. These two concepts are
both reactive, and as such can be improved with the addition of a third
proactive concept: circuit breakers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Circuit breakers are just a few lines of code, maybe using something
like Redis to maintain counters of failures and their timestamps. With
each failure to a service (or a particular endpoint on that service),
the client increments a failure counter and compares it to a certain
threshold. Maybe that threshold is 10 failures in 1 minute, or for
higher volume systems maybe 5 failures in a second. </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So in our example, Service A might notice that service B is down after
the 10th error in 1 second, and at that point it opens the circuit
breaker, meaning it completely stops making calls to that system. This
will decrease the load on downstream services (B, C, and D), giving them
a chance to recover. This also avoids the "running out of threads" issue
we discussed previously. Even with service A giving up after 1s, that&#8217;s
still 1s that thread could have spent handling other requests. </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What to do when a circuit breaker is open? It depends on the feature the
circuit breaker is wrapping.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Immediately respond with an error, letting the user know the required
system is down, and to try again later</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a secondary system kick in that handles things in a different way</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divert traffic to a cluster of servers elsewhere</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Record information about the attempt and have customer services reach
out</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That&#8217;s only a quick intro to circuit breakers, so head over to see
<a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html">Martin Fowler explain
circuit breakers in depth</a> if you want more information on the topic.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Service Meshes" like <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/">Envoy</a> or
<a href="http://conduit.io">Conduit.io</a> are also great solutions for this problem.
Instead of asking you to code it up yourself and the application level,
it can be handled with network-level tools which are able to be
controlled more centrally.</p>

<h2 id="_change_management">11. Change Management</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Change Management in relation to APIs, is a collective term for making
improvements over time. Hopefully the change is handled in a
non-breaking fashion, giving you ample time to make necessary changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a two main approaches to change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Versioning</strong> - Shoving a version number (v1, v2, v3) next to things, or
in some odd cases the version is a date. The version might apply to the
entire API (global versioning), or a single resource (resource
versioning).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Evolution</strong> - Instead of versioning the whole API, or specific
resources/endpoints, some APIs will instead chose to carefully evolve
their interface over time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s go more in depth into these concepts, and how they come into
effect in various API paradigms.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_rest_endpoint_based_apis">11.1. <strong># # # # # # # # # # # # # # #</strong> # REST / "Endpoint-based" APIs</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&lt;$Scr_H::2&gt;<strong>Global Versioning</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&lt;!$Scr_H::2&gt;API endpoints are grouped (essentially "namespaced") under a
version number, e.g.
<a href="https://hostname/v1/companies"><code>https://hostname/v1/companies</code></a>, to make
it clear that a <code>/v1/companies</code> has no relation whatsoever to a
<code>/v2/companies</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="http://semver.org/">SemVer</a> terms, the version number in the URL is a
major version. You should expect no breaking changes to occur in this
major version, as that would be the job for a new major version. All
resources should be copied from the old version to the new version,
unless they&#8217;re being discontinued.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most APIs will not bother with minor or patch versions, because minor
and patch changes are backwards compatible. Adding new fields to
responses, new optional fields to requests or new resources will not
break implementations, so that can be done without needing a major
version. Changing validation rules, removing fields, or drastic changes
to relationships, are things that may require a new major version be
created.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Usually old versions will be maintained for a reasonable timeframe, but
what&#8217;s considered reasonable is completely up to the API maintainers. It
could be one month, a year, or anything in between.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_evolution">11.1.1. Evolution</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>API evolution is the concept of striving to maintain the "I" in API, the
request/response body, query parameters, general functionality, etc.,
only breaking them when you absolutely, absolutely, have to; then when
you do, you manage that change with sensible warnings to clients. It&#8217;s
the idea that API developers bending over backwards to maintain a
contract, no matter how annoying that might be, is often more
financially and logistically viable than dumping the workload onto a
wide array of clients. No version numbers exist in the URL, headers, or
query string, and no two versions of the same resource will exist at any
given time. There is only the "current version".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just like in global versioning, backwards compatible changes like adding
new methods to existing resources, new fields to responses, new optional
fields to requests, new resources, etc. These can happen any time,
without clients needing to change anything. For example, splitting
"name" into "first_name" and "last_name". The "name" field would still
appear in responses along with the new first_name and last_name fields,
and could still be sent. This is a perfect evolution, because nothing
broke for the client, and the server supports the new functionality -
allowing folks to be specific about their first and last names instead
of the server guessing by splitting on space or something silly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Where evolution differs from global versioning, is that instead of
creating a whole new namespace (forcing clients that don&#8217;t even use the
specific changing resources to update/test code at great time and
expense), a single new resource is made to replace the existing resource
when adding new fields is not going to cover the use-case.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, a carpooling company that has "matches" as a relationship
between "drivers" and "passengers", suggesting folks who could ride
together, containing properties like "passenger_id" and "driver_id".
They realized they need to support carpools with multiple drivers (i.e.
Frank and Sally both take it in turns to drive), so this whole matches
concept is garbage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At a lot of startups, this sort of conceptual change is common. No
number of new properties is going to help out here, as the whole "one
record = one match = one driver + one passenger" concept is foiled.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deprecating the whole concept of "matches", a new concept of "riders" is
created. This resource tracks folks far beyond just being "matched",
through the whole lifecycle of the carpool, thanks to a <code>status</code>
property containing pending, active, inactive, blocked, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By creating the <code>/riders</code> endpoint, this resource can have a brand new
representation. The API maintainers may well be converting matches to
riders - or riders to matches - in the background, but clients don&#8217;t
need to care about that. Clients can then use either one, allowing them
the change to upgrade at their own pace.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_graphql_2">11.2. GraphQL</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GraphQL also uses the evolution approach, and this works the same as the
REST / "Endpoint-based" API evolution approach. GraphQL APIs following
evolution carefully will try to avoid breaking changes, sticking to
backwards compatible changes like adding optional fields to mutations
and queries, new arguments on fields, new relationships, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When these backwards compatible changes are not going to be enough to
provide the new functionality required, new mutations and new types
might be created: just like the matches and riders example above. In
another system, maybe a "Company" becomes an "Account" if that is more
appropriate to the constantly changing business language, but maybe
Company2 is created if not. This should only be done when the existing
type is utterly unable to bend to the new rules of the context, and
simply suggesting new fields cannot satisfy requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Global versioning is not possible in GraphQL. When raised with Facebook
the topic was closed with a WONTFIX, so you will not have to worry about
that.</p>

<h4 id="_deprecations">11.3.1. Deprecations</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regardless of the type of API you are interacting with, and which
approach it takes to change management, deprecation is going to be an
important part of keeping up with the change. Any time a change is not
just additive, deprecation will be used to communicate a breaking
change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deprecation is the art of telling people to stop using a thing, because
that thing is probably going away at some point. Even if there are no
solid plans to delete the thing entirely, the thing might be deprecated
just because it sucks to work with, but usually it&#8217;s because it has been
replaced with a better idea.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sadly there are no promises the team in charge will deprecate things
cautiously. Some API providers act like jerks and just arbitrarily
change things, remove things, and break stuff. Closing APIs down with no
warning (or poor warning) is utterly disgraceful behavior, but it does
happen. Facebook especially like to pull the rug out on their API users.
Sometimes breaking changes are introduced accidentally.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Usually a more reasonable approach is taken, and API providers will
communicate change in a variety of ways. There are a few common methods
to keeping up with the changing happening to an API integrated into your
codebase.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_low_tech_general_solutions">11.4. Low-Tech General Solutions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As ludicrous as it might sound, the entire extent of some API providers
attempts to communicate upcoming change is "write a blog about it and
hope you notice."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These blog articles explain things like "Hey we&#8217;re closing off the free
access to this API", or "We are replacing this Foo API with a Bar API,
and you have 3 months to stop using the Foo API before we shut it down".
Fingers crossed you see it!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This low-tech approach has no real solutions I can think of, other
than&#8230;&#8203; subscribe to the api providers engineering blog on RSS, and - so
long as the RSS reader you&#8217;re using doesn&#8217;t get shut down - you might
notice the article. If they have a newsletter then subscribe to that,
maybe with a "devs@" email address or team-specific email address, to
improve the bus factor on this. You don&#8217;t want the announcement going to
a member of the team who&#8217;s quit, then the API breaks just because the
rest of the team didn&#8217;t know about the change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>APIs requiring authentication will usually ask for an email address in
return for the authentication credentials (API keys, access tokens,
etc.) This gives API providers one more way to get in touch about
change, and again, make sure it&#8217;s not the email of a manager or team
lead, but a distribution email address for the team.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_rest_endpoint_based_apis_2">11.5. REST / Endpoint-based APIs</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If an API is using global versioning, then they might deprecate all the
endpoints under <code>/v1/</code> at the same time, and suggest you use all the
<code>/v2/</code> endpoints. If they&#8217;re using evolution they might suggest that
<code>/companies</code> is going away, and you should start to work with
<code>/accounts</code> instead. The suggestions here may come in the form of
low-tech announcements, but they can also be communicated in-band.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_deprecated_endpoints">11.5.1. Deprecated Endpoints</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a a proposed standard:
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-sunset-header-05">Sunset Header</a>,
which at the time of writing is at draft 05. APIs can add a simple
header to the HTTP response, to let clients know the endpoint is nearing
the end of its life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Supporting Sunset is as simple as sniffing for the <code>sunset</code> header, and
it contains a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.1.1">HTTP
date</a> which looks a little like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Sunset: Sat, 31 Dec 2018 23:59:59 GMT</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The proposed standard also allows responses to contain a HTTP <code>link</code>
header, with <code>rel=sunset</code>. The link can be a link to anything, the
endpoint replacing it, a link to some human readable documentation, a
blog post, whatever.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keep an eye out for sunset headers and their accompanying links coming
back in responses your code is getting, and log, or alert, or pass to a
dashboard accordingly. If you are using Ruby or PHP there are already
easy to use middleware for the most popular HTTP clients:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>PHP:</strong>
<a href="https://github.com/hskrasek/guzzle-sunset">hskrasek/guzzle-sunset</a></p>

<p><strong>Ruby:</strong>
<a href="https://github.com/wework/faraday-sunset">wework/faraday-sunset</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sunset is on
<a href="https://github.com/dret/I-D/tree/master/sunset-header">GitHub</a>, and the
issue tracker is used for discussion around it&#8217;s development. Some API
gateways like <a href="https://tyk.io">Tyk</a> are building in support, and it is
going to become far more wide-spread over time. If you make an
implementation for your favorite HTTP client please get in touch with
@apisyouwonthate on Twitter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another approach commonly used by API providers is to provide SDKs, and
if they are kept up to date they will fling out deprecation warnings
about resources that are going away.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you get these notifications, check the errors for what to do next,
or go to their documentation to figure it out, or shout at their
customer support for not making it clear what you&#8217;re meant to be doing
next and they&#8217;ll do a better job next time.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_deprecating_properties">11.5.2. Deprecating Properties</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other than the entire endpoint going away, specific properties <em>may</em>
over time be deprecated. This is less common in global versioning as
they would just remove those in the next global version. It is not a
regular occurrence in evolution as they too would just wait until the
creation of a new resource for the concept, but it can happen if a
property absolutely has to go away.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>JSON is the main content type in use these days, which does not have a
type system built in. There is no way to mark a JSON field as deprecated
in just JSON, and no standards exist to help, even JSON Schema still has
this on the todo list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again SDKs can mark things as deprecated over time, especially those
built with OpenAPI v3.0.0 or later. OpenAPI added the <code>deprecated: true</code>
keyword, so SDKs can now look for this and fire off deprecation warnings
for clients using that property in their code. Keeping up to date is
important, so make sure something like <a href="https://snyk.io/">Snyk</a> or
<a href="https://greenkeeper.io/">Greenkeeper</a> is implemented to keep tabs on
dependencies.</p>

<h3 id="_graphql_3">11.6. GraphQL</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GraphQL pushes hard for evolution in its marketing and most advice in
the ecosystem, which is awesome. They do not have a huge amount of
documentation covering deprecations, and much of it comes from
third-parties like Apollo, but it&#8217;s certainly possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_deprecating_types">11.6.1. Deprecating Types</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead of endpoints, GraphQL has types. There is no first class support
for deprecating types in GraphQL at the time of writing, so an API
developer is unable to evolve the concept through adding new properties,
a new type will pop up somewhere. A low-tech solution like a blog or
email announcement may be used to communicate this new type, and the
deprecation of the old type, as there is no way to do it in band.
Another solution is to deprecate all the properties in the type, and
mark in the reason that the whole type is going away.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_deprecating_properties_2">11.6.2. Deprecating Properties</h4>

chapter a month. Here&#8217;s a few that I expect to add in before considering
the book complete:</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>API Proxies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State Management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Form Generation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offline Syncing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asynchronous Requests</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m also trying to figure out how to get AMQP and WebSocket in here,
possible with their own sections. It will get there.</p>
