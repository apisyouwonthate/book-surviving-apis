= Introduction

Web APIs are just code somebody else wrote, that lives on a server
controlled by somebody else. The acronym API itself stands for
"Application Program Interface", and thatâ€™s what it says on the tin: an
interface for interacting with an application.

This is a rather generic term in the world of computer science and
programming, as a Linux command-line utility would consider its command
names and options to be an API, whilst a Java library would also
consider its method names and arguments to be an API.

Essentially itâ€™s all the same concept, but when talking about Web APIs
weâ€™re talking about the utilization of network protocols such as HTTP,
AMQP, etc., and instead of command-line arguments or method parameters,
weâ€™re working with URLs, query string parameters, or chunks of data like
JSON.

The goal of a Web API is to provide other applications with access to
specific subset of functionality and data that this application owns.
Some APIs are public (anyone can get the weather from
http://api.weather.gov[api.weather.gov]), some are private (itâ€™s
probably tough to get access to JPMorgan Chaseâ€™s Enterprise Customers
API), and some are a mixture.

APIs can give you data for a single-page JavaScript application, handle
payment information so you donâ€™t have to worry about storing credit card
details, post a Facebook status on a users timeline, or share the same
data across a myriad of different devices. Watch that Netflix show on
your Xbox, itâ€™s all good, APIs have you covered.

For a long time my job was designing and building APIs, Then it was
coaching and advising other teams how to build APIs. In more recent
years, it has shifted towards helping different teams building different
software interact with each others systems. These are sometimes
architectural concerns, but a lot of it comes down to clients calling
other systems and knowing what to do with the responses.

Essentially the role has been making HTTP interactions reliable, warning
people of potential problems like: donâ€™t assume everything is going to
be JSON, normalizing state management into the API instead of having
loads of clients doing subtly different guesswork, how to configure
timeouts to stop half the companyâ€™s applications crashing, and improving
performance with smart usage of HTTP caching. This advice seemed like it
should also go into a book, because Iâ€™ve learned a substantial amount
from my time working at WeWork.

This book aims to help you interact with an API that is already built.
It will explain things from the users perspective, and if you do happen
to be an API developer, this might give you some insight into how users
will be interacting with your API. Everyone wins. That said, if you want
help building fantastic web APIs, this might not be first book you
should read, and instead you should consider picking up a copy of
http://apisyouwonthate.com[_Build APIs You Wonâ€™t Hate_]. This is for the
frontend folks, and those building systems that talk to other systems.

== Terminology

APIs are built by all sorts of folks; maybe another company, some large
like Google or Facebook, startups, governments, or charity
organizations. They could also be coworkers on another team, or another
department, on another floor (or continent). Maybe you built an API
because youâ€™re a full-stack developer who can do frontend and backend!
This whole time weâ€™re going to refer to "them" as the guardians of these
Web API(s), and assume we have little control over the API.

Those writing code that interact with APIs are usually called "API
Clients" or "user agents", and that is usually a frontend application
(browser app, iOS app, Android app, etc.), or it can actually be another
backend application. Backend applications talking to other Web APIs
share a lot of the same properties as a frontend application talking to
another API, so this book is aimed at all of you.

Web API, microservice, service, etc, theyâ€™re all terms that mean subtly
different things, that are often used interchangeably by some. For the
duration of this book, weâ€™re just going to say API. A micro service, or
a service, will probably have an API, otherwise itâ€™s not doing anything.
So when you see the generic term API, you know weâ€™re talking about a web
API, which might be part of a service, micro service, a gateway to
multiple microservices, or a giant monolithic application with some API
endpoints jammed into it. Itâ€™s all the same as far as API interaction is
concerned.

== Do we really need to read a book?

Integrating an API is meant to be easy, and backend engineers will often
just throw that phrase around without really understanding what theyâ€™re
asking from people.

If youâ€™ve never integrated with an API then thereâ€™s a bit of a learning
curve. Beyond that, there are a lot of things to learn, a lot of
acronyms and jargon, a lot of conflicting advice on StackOverflow, and a
lot of people spouting really bad advice. There are different types of
API (REST, RPC, GraphQL, SOAP), different types of transportation layer,
lots of different errors to understand, and a tricky balancing act to
make your applications both performant and up-to-date with this data
that lives somewhere else. Many people donâ€™t think about HTTP timeouts
or the effects an accidental 10s hang could have on downstream systems.
What happens if the user gets on a subway half way through a
transaction... Even something as simple as an unexpected validation rule
coming back from the API can leave user stuck in a tween-state, with a
blank screen and no way to progress. AGGH!

Some of this would be easier if API developers documenting things
extensively, but most of the time youâ€™re lucky to get an out-of-date
Word document called API Documentation-v2-33-January-18-Final.doc.
Sometimes you might have to guess a contract, and thatâ€™s no easy feat.

Some of these problems are just lessons learned over time, but in the
mean time your application can be suffering all sorts of bug reports,
user complaints, server issues, and who knows what other sort of
production issues. If itâ€™s not as dire as that, there are at least other
sources of confusion thatâ€™ll get you spinning your wheels trying to
figure out what to do next. Throughout the 2000s, most of us web
developers were building frontend and the backend in the same
application. The frontend was just whatever HTML the backend decided to
spit out. Frontend developers would design the templates (HTML + data
tags), and the backend would decide which HTML template to show, and
what values to shove into those tags. Go Smarty.

It was a simple time, but there was a lot wrong with it. Sharing data
between apps was awful, and the amount of iframe trickery was scary. One
time I was working on an integration where a financial services company
set up a deal to provide the stocks and shares information for the MSN
Money UK homepage. We generated full HTML on our site, (possibly
generated from a CMS that was not expecting this sort of thing), they
read the whole thing, regex replaced some special tags added just for
them, cached it somehow, and shoved their own CSS on it...

It was around this time I started blogging about APIs. ðŸ¤”

Thankfully weâ€™ve mostly escaped that swamp, and the vast majority of
companies are building APIs first. On the desktop itâ€™s all about
single-page JavaScript applications, with Angular/Ember/React using data
binding to pull down and push back data from a data source, and mobiles
often work very similarly, regardless of if the apps are HTML based or
native. These frontend applications cannot do all that much by
themselves, so they need to hook up to APIs to do _something_. That
something might be as simple as persisting data to the server, enabling
communications with other users, charging somebodies credit card, etc.

== External APIs

These days most architectures involve at least one external API (an API
built by another company), and that trend is only going to continue.

Think about older video games like Rollercoaster Tycoon. They were
developed singlehandedly, by one software developer who could do a bunch
of things. Over time, the expectations for video games have shot up so
much that no one person could ever create the next bestselling video
game singlehandedly. Now there are whole teams of people who work on
physics engines, some folks figure out how to make realistic hair, and
everyone focuses on building their specific modules.

Most smaller game studios will skip building their own physics engines
and simply pay the licensing fee to use an existing software, because
they donâ€™t have the human-power to build their own, and itâ€™s probably
cheaper. APIs are very much the same sort of idea. Startups donâ€™t have
time to build their own SMS messaging service, so they just use Twilio.
Itâ€™s fantastic, it only takes a few minutes to get started, and it means
that startup can focus on their application, which is going to make the
world a better place through drone-based, underwear folding in-the-home.

If something awfully complex pops up like geocoding, most folks will
just shove Google Maps API in there, or Mapbox API, or OpenStreet Map
API, because generating a standard interface for wildly different
datasets around the globe is a mess, and why waste time on that when
youâ€™ve got underpants to fold!

== Breaking Down the Monolith

Over the last few years, the rise of the service (or micro service) has
meant youâ€™ll often be working with more than one API. External APIs
might be replaced with internal APIs as your teams grow and ownership
becomes more important, and larger applications can start to become an
unmanageable non-performant mess. This really makes sense for companies
with larger engineering teams, who want to avoid stepping on each others
toes with changes they make. The more services at play, the more complex
everything gets, but a mature, and educated engineering department with
a strong devops culture can eventually learn to manage this.

A lot of teams who are just getting started with building services kinda
forget about this integration part, and forget their systems are going
to be used by a myriad of others. As companies grow, other developers
want to start hooking into these data sources, and often the original
developers have moved on. You end up with all these random things
talking to other random things and the architectural diagrams (if kept
up to date) would look like an octopus orgy.

These services need to talk to each other intelligently, handle various
types of error, have realistic timeouts, know when to retry, and most
importantly identify themselves, so you donâ€™t end up with a stampeding
herd; with no idea which client is causing it.

These services also need frontends, or have one mega dashboard that
handles the UI for many of them.

One of these scenarios is where you probably come in, so with the why
covered, letâ€™s look at how.
